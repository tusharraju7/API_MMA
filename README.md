### Sentiment Analysis with API Data

This repository features a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of sentiment analysis using data retrieved from APIs. The project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify text data into sentiment categories and evaluates the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier.

**Key Features:**
1. Data Retrieval: Automates the extraction of review data via APIs.
2. Data Preprocessing: Implements text cleaning, tokenization, and data structuring for analysis.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes the NLTK library to apply sentiment analysis techniques.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.

**Objectives:**
1. To develop a robust model capable of accurately classifying the sentiment of reviews.
2. To illustrate the complete workflow from data collection to preprocessing, training, and evaluating a sentiment analysis model.

This repository is ideal for students, data scientists, and developers interested in understanding and applying sentiment analysis using Python and NLP techniques.
