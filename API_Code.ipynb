       "\"I'm picky with fish n chips. Yes, I'm a Madonna. It's so easy to screw up fish and chips. You'd think it's easy to cook, but there really is an art to it. The right batter with good seasoning, the right temperature to the oil, crisp fries and for the love of God, fresh fish! So given the great ratings on Yelp, I was pretty excited to finally have the chance to try Fresco's... and boy was I disappointed. I was expecting greatness, but what I got was a small portion of overcooked, dry and flavorless fish and soggy and under seasoned fries for $15.I had the halibut, and being my first time I had it done half and half (half regular batter, half Ms. Vickie's).  The Ms. Vickie's batter is definitely the better of the two, have more crunch and texture, while the regular batter was soft and just not good. The fish wasn't overly oily, which is good, but the fish itself was very dry.  You know how in good fish and chips, the fish will flake apart? That lovely texture that just falls apart in your mouth? Well, this isn't it. The fish was chewy, dry and definitely wasn't seasoned. I ended up throwing a ton of seasoning salt, lemon and tartar sauce on it just to give it some life. Onto the second part of the equation: fries. They sure looked delicious, but again the lack of seasoning hurt the verdict, and the fries were a big soggy to boot.  I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I expected a lot more from a place which has a 4.5 stars average rating on Yelp (which I treat like the bible).It's not many times Yelp will disappoint me, but this was definitely one of them.\""

When you think of a place like Toronto, your first instinct is that Canadian food would be the most popular. But Canada is a melting pot of cultures, and there's a strong Asian influence here. We figured all the rave reviews about this place was reason enough to see what all the hype was about. We got here on a Tuesday evening and it was so packed that we waited for 35 minutes!! I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Tuesday. That was my initial indication that I was about to have some good food. The ambiance was casual but cool at the same time. Have you ever been to one of those famous people that post famous people's pictures who have visited their restaurant on the wall before? It was very much like that. While we were waiting for a table we decided to have a drink at the bar. There were no bar stools which was great because we didn't have to fight anyone for the bartenders attention, so we stayed standing up ordering drinks and enjoying them. We had the Lowry and the Thai mojito, my fiancés favorite was the Lowry and mine was the Thai mojito. Both were Very smooth and easy to drink. Once we sat down, the service was incredibly fast which was surprising since it was so busy. We were attended to right away, they would come backTo check on us and if we needed anything, it wouldn't take long to get it. We noticed that the most popular item on Yelp was the pad Thai, so even though it's such a typical Thai food item, we had to try it. The pad Thai was really good, we got almost the spiciest level (faraang spicy) and added extra spice on the side but it wasn't as spicy as Thai food in LA where we're originally from usually is. The pad Thai was my fiancés favorite all time pad Thai, I'm a little bit more of a food snob, to me it was a solid 4.5 star out of 5, loved it but I feel like I've had slightly better, but it was definitely top 10 I've ever had everywhere I've traveled. We ordered the grabong (squash fritters), even though we read a review from someone saying that it didn't have flavor. Let me tell you, as long as you dip it in the dip they provide you, it is popping full of flavor. By itself without the dip, it's pretty plain. We loved it and dipped to our hearts content. I noticed the Khao Soi soup looking dish seemed like my kind of meal, so I couldn't pass up ordering it, and I'm glad I did. There was so much broth that after eating it with the noodles, I ordered white rice and added it into the soup and it's like I had 2 meals from the same dish. And in my opinion it was great with noodles but even better with the white rice!! The flavor was also finger licking good. I would love to come back and try more dishes here\", 'positive')]\n"

Roasted Suckling Pig-this dish contained crispy pork belly and a piece of pork shoulder served with a variety of veggies. Wow, this was the best pork that my SO and I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, tender, and seasoned. We almost licked the plate.2. Chicken Fried Oyster Mushroom-this dish came with perfectly battered mushrooms that tasted filling like protein. The perfect amount of Mayo and sesame seeds to finish.3. Penokean Hills Beef Tartare-this tartare was well seasoned and came with Bibb lettuce. There needed to be more lettuce but flavors were excellent.4. Duck Liver Pate-this dish was served with brioche which was a bit too thick and dry to accompany the pate. A lighter bread ursThe pate itself is flavorful and texture-ful but the strong strawberry scent masked the taste of the dish itself.5. Station Burger-voted Toronto's burger, this is a combination of sweet and savory with some sort of jam and Mayo with a perfectly cooked patty. Unfortunately, compared to everything else, this wasn't the best thing we've had. However, still solid!Service was excellent, and interior was nicely decorated.The meal itself comes with complimentary bread. The focaccia bread with cream and sunflower oil was also tasty. A little toasting of the bread and extra cream would have made it perfect.\",\n",

The restaurant is situated in a rather unassuming building and, upon entering, it appears to be quite small. However, after walking past the downstairs portion, you are greeted by a series of modular dining rooms that are very large. Upon being seated at the chef's bar, my wife and I were greeted quickly and given excellent, prompt service throughout. The sommelier did seem a bit unsure of himself, but he was still quite kind and attentive. Drinks wise, we enjoyed the wine pairings. The pairings worked well, but only one white wine surprised me and none of the pairings were such that I would assert the wine paring itself is a necessity. We both had the chef's tasting menu and were delighted. Some of the most memorable dishes were the egg-based salad, the amuse bouche, and the strawberry shortcake dessert. The only disappointment was the duck, which felt like it wasn't rendered quite right.If this were a Michelin started restaurant with multi hundred dollar prices, I would have given Richmond Station a 4. But the sheer value of a place that by most counts measures up with its accoladed brothers and sisters, earns a 5 star rating in my book.

The canapes were such a fun selection, and a great way to lead into the meal. The dry-aged beef was memorable and delicious.I will say for myself, the highlight of the tasting menu was Linda's enthusiastic descriptions of our paired wines and how its balances with the upcoming course.

I was disappointed at the lack of communication by the restaurant staff as I tried calling multiple times but was unable to reach anyone. I messaged on OpenTable and did not get a response either.

Although the rest of the evening went perfectly fine, I wonder why the restaurant staff felt that this table seating was appropriate for any diner! In terms of the food, we ordered the Burrata, a salad, the Funghi pizza and cheesecake for dessert. The burrata was delicious and great starter! The flavours and texture of the dish went perfectly together, especially the candied walnuts which gave a nice hint of sweetness. The salad was also solid but nothing much to write home about. The Funghi pizza was loaded with mushrooms; the dough was thin and the crust was soft and chewy! Very much enjoyed it. We rounded off dinner with the cheesecake which tasted a lot like a Japanese cheesecake to me in both flavour and texture. It was light and cakey at the same time; the berry compote gave a nice tartness to complement the sweet.

The location was fairly loud, making it challenging to hear each other, especially in the somewhat dark and dimly lit setting.

So tasty, so many textures, and a delicious and beautiful start to the meal. Burrata - never had burrata like this. A cold dish with Chinese flavors over a luxurious ball of gooey cheese. Very delicious and unique. Chicken bao - everyone loved these. Beautiful buns, really succulent chicken, and nice veg inside. Curry chicken - we had such high expectations for this, and it was the biggest letdown of the dinner unfortunately. The chicken skin was a bit flabby, there were unexpected bits of cartilage which I actually usually like but just was not expected in this presentation, and the onion pancakes didn\\'t have good texture - to dry and stiff. \"Pad thai\" - only very loosely resembles pad thai and uses orzo pasta. Shrimp were cooked well and this was a tasty dish. Desserts really shined here. The tong Yuen was so decadent and interesting. I loved all the textures. It was a touch on the acidic side for me, but I loved it! Matcha panna cotta - this would be my first pick. Just the right amount of matcha, beautiful sauces, and really delicious sticky rice as well.',\n",

I was very excited about dining here, and glad I had the pleasure to do so.Decor-We sat outside, so I can't really critique the decor on the inside of this restaurant. The tables outside were clean neatly organized and close together.Service-i've got to say, the service here was spectacular. Our server was upbeat, very pleasant, and very knowledgeable about the menu.Food-this is where the fun really starts, the food is  eccentric and the flavors are quite the experience.   Every dish was a surprise, even though not every dish deserved 5/5 stars, it was still quite the experience.Singapore style slaw-100/5 Stars!!! I'm not entirely sure what the 20 ingredients are of this dish, but they work perfectly together, it's like a well practiced symphony partying in your mouth. This dish has so many levels of textures from crunch, too wet, to dry, and it is just the perfect dish.Oyster shooters-2.5/5 stars. This dish was a miss for us, we didn't care for the flavors too much, and frankly, it was overpriced. Would not order this again.Indochine Rack of Lamb-2.5/5 stars. Our waiter recommended this dish and I'll say it was good, but missed the five star rating. I wish we would've tried something a little more Asian inspired.French and Chinéese Tong Yuen-100/5 Stars. This has to be the most interesting and flavorful dessert I've had this year. As you take your first bite, your hit with a fruity sorbet flavor, and then it turns into a chocolatey nutty treat at the end of the bite. It's a large bite, but your rewarded with every chew and it just works!!!Can't wait to be back.\",\n",

Our group tried the tasting menu for $100 each and was well worth the price of admission getting to try a wide variety of what the restaurant offered. Each dish came out and was explained in detail so you know exactly what you're getting. Started with a Summer Sangria (not part of the tasting menu) and was very surprised when a cart was rolled over table side to get my drink served fresh which I would definitely recommend. The food came out at a good pace and got to enjoy everything as it came.Our tasting menu came with:Appetizers-Singapore Style Slaw: the Signature dish of the restaurant. It was a good mix of freshness, flavours, and textures. -Oyster shots: part of the specials for the day. Oyster in a shot of dashi broth and caviar. Bursting with umami-Bacon Cheeseburger Spring Rolls: eat them like tacos as per the recommendation. Definitely emulated a bacon cheeseburger in spring roll form.Mains-Pan Seared Diver Scallops and Chorizo: Fresh seared scallops and chorizo-Wild Alaskan Caramelized Black Cod: the favourite of our table. Delicious flaky cod in a nice miso sauce with mashed radish on the side-Indochine Rack of Lamb: Rack of lamb using a bit more Indian flavours and it honestly worked really well-Top Chef Curry Roasted Chicken: the Signature main dish. Chicken was moist in a curry. Would have liked a bit more sauce, but honestly everything worked well togetherDessert-French and Chinese Tang Yuen: New take on the classic Chinese dessert that worked really well with a unique combination of ingredients-Rhubarb Tart: special for the day and was pleasantly surprised. Not usually that big on rhubarb but this worked really well and wasn't too sweet.Overall, good experience with the tasting menu and would recommend everyone to try at least once.\",\n",

It felt like too much was going on. The chicken itself was bland and while the accompaniments are likely meant to be the primary source of flavour, it felt a bit mish mashed.The Wild Alaskan Black Cod was probably the BEST fish dish I've ever had! Every component was delicious and melded together well.Our dessert, the Chocolate Peanut Butter Bar, was rich and dense, though I wish the bar itself had more textural variety.

       " ['First time trying Lee\\'s so we opted to do the \"chef\\'s banquet\". It was an interesting experience. The food is bold it it\\'s attempts to push the e boundaries of fusion. While some creations shine with a great balance of flavours, others are overly complicated and do a disservice to the quality of the ingredients.Before dissecting each dish individually, the staff were excellent. Each dish brought out was fully explained in full detail. Water was kept full at all times, and the plates and silverware were changed between almost every dish. While the level of service did not go unappreciated, some intentions were lost along the way. Because each dish is so overly complicated with an extensive number of ingredients, the servers were visibly struggling with trying to explain what the dish was and what was in it. Some were speaking so fast I could only pick up on 2-3 ingredients. Also not the servers\\' fault but the time between each dish was agonizingly long. It\\'s a good thing we had enough to talk about at the table. Each dish takes 2 minutes to eat but half an hour to arrive. We were dining for 2.5 hours, of which 90% of the time was just waiting.On to the food. The Singapore slaw lives up to its expectations. It\\'s light, it\\'s fragrant, and it\\'s balanced with savoury and acidic. It\\'s a very refreshing salad that I could eat every day for lunch and not be disappointed. They do a little table side show we\\'re they mix the salad and mention something about the higher they toss the salad the more prosperity it brings. A fun little anecdote for diners.The oyster shooter was an interesting choice. It\\'s almost like a caesar but with an oyster at the end. While I enjoyed the taste, there was far too much shot to take at once. The oyster is fresh and the shot is briney, but I didn\\'t find it anything special. The cheeseburger spring roll was a little bit of a let down. It\\'s a ground beef and cheese spring roll with a side piece of bacon, wrapped in a piece of iceberg lettuce. We were recommended to try it and I found it quite disappointing. It\\'s exactly what you would think it tastes like. Hot greasy beef and cheese, over a small piece of lettuce. I will admit I enjoyed it with the vinegary vegetables in between the lettuce and the roll, but the spring roll on its own is just a mess of salt and grease.The beef satay was much better. The beef was very tender and cooked to a perfect medium. The satay sauce was nutty, decadent and flavourful. It was topped with what I believe was a shrimp cracker. The black cod was in my opinion the real star of the show. Delicious flaky cod, in a savoury black bean sauce, paired with a turnip purée. It was so delicious and a real winner in my books. Balanced, not overly salty or savoury, and just full of flavour.The rack of lamb in tamarind sauce was a bittersweet delight. The lamb in the sauce was excellent. The lamb was so succulent and juicy and was just cooked to perfection. The sauce is rich, salty, creamy and really did enhance the natural juiciness of the lamb. However my first bite was tarnished with that abomination underneath. The polenta and paneer cake was just a dull mush of bland filler. Eating it together with the lamb just ruined all the flavour of the lamb. I thought I had eaten the worst piece of lamb every cooked. It was only after trying the lamb separately that my tongue was blessed with salvation. Get rid of the polenta and paneer, it does not go with the dish.The dessert was a mixed bowl of shaved ice and fruit in coconut cream, and a spoonful bite of mochi mixed with nuts. It was an interesting dessert. It\\'s presented with dry ice for a smoke effect. The fruit mix is fragrant with a familiar scent, and there is a nice variety of fruit. It was a nice refreshing way to end the meal, although all the ice was clumped and stuck together. The mochi ball was definitely an interesting choice. It\\'s overly complex with a mixture of different sauces and flavours. It starts by being sweet, then bitter, and then chocolatey and nutty. Unfortunately, not in a good way. There was far too much going on that you can\\'t appreciate what you are eating. It just scrambles itself with so many ingredients that in the end all you taste is burnt peanut.Overall it was an interesting experience. The staff try very hard and are very attentive. Kitchen service is painstakingly slow at churning out dishes. Some bites of food really shine through as excellent creations. While others aspire to be more than they are with over complexities and over-complications. This restaurant is capable of so much more. Don\\'t try so hard to be something that you aren\\'t. Sometimes less is more. There are so many ingredients in each dish, the servers word vomit struggle to explain them. And then I nod politely while only hearing 3 out of 20 ingredients.',\n",

A super fun environment! The food- I would rate it 100 stars if I could. We got a few things to start:- Wasabi Octopus- this is the most painful and most delicious thing I've ever tasted. The wasabi would kick you butt and then disappear in seconds. I felt it in my nose and my toes. - Baked Oyster - I hate mushrooms, but this was so well seasoned and the flavors worked so well. A mix of creamy, savory and delicious- Calamari - Cooked so well and hand breaded. The flavors were a little spicy but also creamy. The crunchy chips on the bottom also give a nice texture. Then came the main courses! My husband ordered udon that was more of a traditional broth udon dish with beef. The broth and beef were so flavorful! It was way more complex than some of the more simple udon-broth dishes you usually get. I ordered the Carbonara Udon. AH-MYZING! The egg was so lightly poached and mixed perfectly with the sauce. Simple in ingredients but perfectly crafted. We were visiting, but I could tell that this was a place that locals also come as well. It was pretty full when we got there, but they were able to seat us quickly. Get a reservation if you can. If you get a chance, this is a place to try!\",\n",

We saw the waiters running around so much we felt bad for them since we could see they were severely understaffed.

We ordered the oyster kakimayo, sashimi platter, carbonara udon, and curry cheese bibimbap. The oyster kakimayo is a fave. We ordered this in Montreal and I liked it there too. It's cheesy and garlicky - what's not to love? The sashimi was good too but pretty standard. My favorite piece was the ebi. The udon was great. It comes with a perfectly poached egg that you mix in with the noodles. Bibimbap was fine - nothing special. It probably could have used more cheese but I don't think it's something you couldn't make at home with those Japanese curry blocks. I wish they had a location in NYC.

The thing I love about Asian restaurants is that they are always open even on stat holidays.They have an interesting selection of drinks and cocktails that are Asian inspired. There are drinks that are made with soju or Japanese flavoured liquors. A popular item in the restaurant is a Soju bomb, where are you? I'll have the staff, screaming and yelling in excitement as you smack on the table and let the soju drop it at a drinkThe menu is definitely designed for sharing . I would say between two people you should order at least 6-8 dishes and expect to spend around $50 each.The portions are a little bit smaller, but depends on the item you got. The best items in my opinion for value for money and based on taste or the wasabi octopus and the carpaccio. The Karaage chicken was really tasty and had an excellent selection of different flavors. The pieces are quite big as well.The disappointing items were the calamari , I thought it would be a classic breaded style. It turned out to be heavily sauce and sweet-and-sour sauce, reminding me of sweet-and-sour pork. Just need to be aware of. Their tuna tartare was tasty but was buried in a sea of avocado, and, guacamole making it hard to appreciate the seafood. It was also served with seaweed pieces, which is less enjoyable, and less substantial, that something like a cracker in my opinion, and also hard to dip and scoop up the food.\",\n",

Crab porridge was by far my favorite - briny and livery from the foie but balanced perfectly with tart apple. Trout and steak courses were also very good. Dessert courses were also excellent. The spiced parsnip was reminiscent of apple pie but the pumpkin custard and winter squash was hands down the best bite of the night - spiced cake that balanced out with a delectable pumpkin custard. Petit fours were a nice way to end the meal.Service here is beyond super. Our server Fred was funny, engaging, accommodating and made our night special.

Unfortunately this time I did not get a seat with a view due to the high volumes of winterlicious diners. However, the staff are very courteous, friendly and attentive.

In all it's definitely a spot I recommend visiting at least once, but perhaps not for a repeat visit. There are other O&B sister restaurants that have better quality food.

It was a clear sunny day, so we had the opportunity to observe Niagara Fall\\'s water splashing up into the sky far away. It was my family (who visited Toronto from overseas)\\'s last dinner in Toronto. We all had a great time here.  We (7 people) had two appetizers (onion soup & bison tartare) and shared the chef\\'s daily selection of seafood (oysters, scallops, shrimp cocktails, smoked salmon, and calamari fries). The bison tartar (mixed with different textured roasted vegetables and foie gras parfait) is refreshing and rich, a great starter.  The chef\\'s selection of seafood was just OK. Of course, we did not have 7 pieces of each item, but because our family members have different preferences for seafood, we did not fight over the same items lol. So, we thought that the size of the platter was good enough for us.  For the main, I had Tournedos Rossini (rare). My partner had Lamb en Crépinette. I loved Tournedos Rossini. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly rare, served on a crouton, and topped with melt-in-the-mouth seared foie gras. The classic Perigueux sauce\\'s distinct truffle flavor matched with the crispy burdock arranged over the meat. I loved the fried celery root puree which came as a garnish for my beef. It had truffle flavor and gave it a fresh and earthy tone to the rare filet mignon. Very satisfying. It was my favorite of the night. My partner was a bit disappointed by the size of the Lamb en Crepinette\\'s loin portion. It was a very small piece. Although it was absolutely good - perfectly cooked \"super tender\" loin served with flavorful morel sauce - the size was really small. It came with a small bowl of a nice lamb shank stew, but he wished he could enjoy the loin portion more than having this stew as an accompaniment.   As we enjoyed the food, we caught a breathtaking view of the sunset. Our waiter was friendly and efficient. We asked him to take our group pictures a few times - and every time we asked, he was happy to do it - I appreciated him for capturing our very rare family get-together moment.

The beef was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the kohlrabi on the side was very interesting (resembled stacked potatoes). The lobster was meaty and plump, but flavour-wise, disappointed me. Perhaps it was the overwhelming taste of lemon, but at times it felt like I was eating dish detergent... not my favourite. That said, this main was better than the truffled risoni, which though fragrant (mmmm truffle) was extremely heavy given the oil and fried mushrooms.I finished with the chocolate delice, which was deeelish.

The chef and team were able to accommodate our changes to the menu (with me no pork and others at my group). They were gracious with our requests. Especially we all ordered the pre-fixe menu with multiple courses. Let's start off -- Atlantic oyster: hmm this was a shock, sure it arrived ON an oyster shell however the taste. Nothing of oyster flavor. It was a puff pastry. Bizarre, we were all a little stomped of this course - basically to start off, not exactly on the right food - venison tartare - very small portion only about two spoons, doesn't really taste like anything much I have ever had. Also had this odd tasting soup on the right. Too hearty to be beef tartare and too flavorless to be tuna tartare, this was different but not for a good thing, but glad I got to try it! Will likely not opt to have this again by choice - finally my fav (I opted out of the bacon/pork) so the chef made me an onion soup inside an onion! wow! Loved it! This was the most tasteful onion soup/consommé I have ever tasted!

Once you are there, it becomes first come first serve and I was happy we arrived early as we got the tables along the windows to enjoy the night view. It wasn't a good idea to eat at the restaurant before a game as it was a rush for us! Canoe is a really nice , fancy restaurant where you can spend more time enjoying the view while having dinner and enjoy your wine . The waiter was amazing as we told them we were on a tight schedule. He told us if we ordered right away, the food would be at our table and we would be ok for time.  I ordered the onion soup $19 and also the Crispy pork jowl $54. Most of the item seem to be seafood related , salmon, fillet, halibut and lobster. I am allergic to fish, so I felt like I didn't have too as much choices as I would like, but it was still ok. The food came pretty quickly and the onion soup was so cute as it came in an onion bowl, they also had a refill for it. The roast loin was super crispy and tasted great. My partner had the surf and turf $96 and bluefin Tuna Tartare $29, both were amazing .  Customer service was great, atmosphere was nice. And we made it to the Raptors game on time. Amazing night ! Will definitely come back again and enjoy in a slower pace itinerary.\",\n",

It's not merely about enjoying sushi; it's about witnessing an ancient art form that's both poetic and palate-pleasing.Nestled in an intimate setting, the decor at Yasu exudes a minimalistic charm that beautifully complements the Omakase experience.What truly makes Yasu a standout is the sheer mastery of the sushi chefs. With every precise slice, artful assembly, and graceful presentation, they transform the freshest, highest quality ingredients into edible masterpieces. Each course in the Omakase lineup unravels like chapters in a story, each more compelling than the last, guiding your senses through a tantalizing array of flavours and textures.The fish, always fresh and sourced from prime locations, shines in its simplicity and purity. The balance between the neta (topping) and shari (rice) is impeccable, reflecting a deep understanding and respect for the craft. The harmonious play of umami-rich flavors, gentle vinegared rice, and subtle nuances of wasabi and pickled ginger in between makes for a dance of tastes that is nothing short of spellbinding.Beyond the sushi, Yasu's service is impeccable. The staff is attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about ensuring every diner's experience is memorable. Their recommendations on sake pairings further elevate the Omakase journey.In the world of sushi, Yasu isn't just a restaurant; it's a temple where the traditions of sushi-making are both honored and innovated. For those seeking an authentic, soul-stirring Omakase experience, Yasu is nothing short of a revelation.\",\n",

Surprisingly my favourite was the cod testicle, super creamy, no fishy flavours, subtle sweetness and very delightful to eat. The monkfish liver was a good one too, again rich and decadent but not rubbery as they poached it. Well seasoned and creamy! Saba was definitely still fishy, but the fresh type with a hint of yuzu.

We were promptly seated and assigned to a chef who would be making all our meals. One of the staff would take our coats and explain the bathroom was upstairs. Afterwards, she showed us the drink menu.The dinner was 17 courses in total with an extra dish for an additional charge. They change the menu every so often so what I got this time might not be the same as someone else a year or so ago had. I liked there was a lot of variety to the meals chosen. I tried sushi I have never tried before or would never have gotten the opportunity to try. The ingredients all seemed very fresh and definitely was a delight to try all the different courses. I would definitely recommend counter over table. You get to see the chefs make the meals and the meals come quicker too.My favourite would have to be the tuna, super fatty, sushi. Honorable mentions include mackerel, tamago and monkfish. However, one thing that I would say is that omakase experience really depends on the chef. The script itself was very generic from all the chefs in general, so there wasn\\'t really a chance to get a \"personal\" experience. Furthermore, the chef I was assigned seemed relatively new and from his skills I could tell he was a rookie. He would frequently forget his lines as well so I didn\\'t seem to even get the generic experience.In general, the variety and freshness of the food was nice. But I think there needs to be a realization that the experience itself is also important in omakase, because it was sad to see it somewhat lacking at Yasu. The four stars is mostly from the good filling 17 courses of sushi I had.',\n",

The coconut cream pie is still the same, but since everyone orders it, perhaps a seasonal variation?

The Buenenuto Valet can point you in the right direction and you see a clear glass door with an acid sketched logo on the door. It is kind of cool.Upon walking in the door there is a lobby and a set of stairs that leads to reception. Inside is a sophisticated restaurant with a great view of downtown Toronto.For our meal, we started with a Bread and Hummus for Two ($7) with a selection of sourdough and a cracker type bread from the Bread Baking Co. It was served with yummy house made hummus with paprika and tahin. For the appetizer, we went with the Foie Gras Terrine ($31) with a sea salt brioche, pickled grapes, riesling jelly, Triple crunch mustard, toasted hazelnuts and sour cherry reduction. It was beautifully divided in half so two could share and plated. Very rich and accented well with the other flavors on the plate.For dinner, my partner had the special which was the Australian Lamb Chops.

My husband loved everything and drove away raving that they would receive at least 1 Michelin Star if they came to Toronto. We ordered the cauliflower soup, lobster salad, seafood risotto, filet mignon, and something evidently not too memorable for dessert since I can't recall two days later, except for the fact that they were lovely to write out Happy Anniversary on the rim of the plate. Cauliflower soup is something my husband makes often because I love cauliflower and I love potatoes, and blending them up together after roasting them creates something magical. We both really really enjoyed the rendition at scaramouche and now my husband is turning over different ideas in his head about how to add some acidity and texture to what we make ourselves. We always add fresh pepper and truffle salt at home, which are some elements I missed, but it was very good nonetheless. Lobster salad--a standout, and my favorite dish of the night. A bit more mayo-heavy than I would've liked, but everything tasted fresh and steamed/cooked perfectly. Seafood risotto--tasted to me like any other seafood medley, where the texture changes but the flavor of the sea doesn't. I'm never a fan of throwing seafood together like this, but my husband thoroughly enjoyed it. Filet mignon--beautifully seasoned and very succulent, but I think we have different definitions of what medium rare means. I've included a photo of the first time I cut open the steak, and it's a tad more medium than what I thought I ordered. However, it was delicious, and the steak and sauce worked harmoniously with everything else on the plate.  The whipped potatoes were also great!! It's about halfway to Joel Robuchon's (in)famous mashed potatoes, which had always been way too fluffy and smooth for my liking. These were buttery without sacrificing just a little bit of texture.

Vitello tonnato - veal carpaccio with crème fresh and capers. Meaty, creamy, delicious. Spaghetti ai Ricci di mare - sea urchin (uni) pasta - what a delight. Rich and creamy uni in a carbonara type sauce. The level of concentrated flavor in this dish is unmatched. Frutti di mare alla griglia - grilled seafood platter for two. Octopus, monk fish, White Sea bass, jumbo prawn, tiger prawn, scallops. Great for sharing or even eat it yourself if you want to indulge. Excellent variety as each one was cooked differently from the other. The monk fish skin was a little tough though. Not a meal I can eat daily otherwise I would die from the richness of the dishes Overall good experience. Would come again.

It's completely different than a normal focaccia bread we're familiar with. It's basically a flat bread with melted cheese and it was delicious. Their branzino was the best dish of the night as well as their clam pasta. The seafood is all cooked to perfection. The service was good, and the ambiance of the place was modern and clean. Their calamari pasta was unique because the pasta is braided; however, I prefer the clam pasta. Next time, I would try their seafood platter. I heard the platter is amazing!

       " [\"(5.0) - It was difficult to experience Osteria Giulia without having prior knowledge of the food, drink and overall vibe because of the overwhelming popularity. That being said, it still surpassed expectations.We came for a weekday dinner service. They've set up the restaurant quite well - as you enter you noticed the dimness of the lights, the quiet mix of conversation with the relatively soft music in the background, and of course the aroma of the food being prepared. There's no denying you've stepped foot into a fine dining establishment. The menu and restaurant is designed with a seafood lens of the Liguira region in northwest Italy.After ordering two martinis, in their classic presentation, we ordered our meal. This included: Acciughe E Burro, Focaccia Di Recco, Vitello Tonnato, Lorighittas Al Mare, Spaghettoni Ai Ricci Di Mare, Frutti Di Mare Alla Griglia, Romanesco and finished with Tiramisu Alla Giulia for dessert. Obviously a number of dishes, but I will highlight the standouts. The Acciughe E Burro was perfectly toasted around the edges and soft within. The whipped butter wasn't too fatty on the palette and the thin anchovy really pulled everything together. The veal carpaccio was incredibly fresh and sophisticated with the addition of the tuna foam in the middle. Surprising enough, the best part of the dish was the foglie di cappero (or caper leaves); the leaves gave the dish an additional layer of acidity which the plate was begging for.Moving on, we dove into our pasta dishes. Both were spectacular but the hand braided Lorighittas played games with your eyes. For context, the interior of Osteria Giulia is a cream coloured with very dim lighting coming from above and candlelight. The shape of the pasta and squid were almost indistinguishable - you didn't know if you were getting a piece of pasta or squid. The dish painted a complete story with no one part of it being the star; a sort of marriage of flavors with each bite. Personally, I could eat this every day. I was nervous when the spaghetti arrived; I've never had or seen tomatoes and sea urchin mix... lucky for me they go together strangely well. Complete different textures, temperatures and flavors made each bite more interesting than the last.Finishing off the meal we had the grilled seafood plate with squid, octopus, jumbo prawns and Hokkaido scallops. The clear star of the dish was the jumbo prawns which were split open and meatier than expected. I was looking forward to the scallops, but they were completely wrapped in dill. Though delicious, I would've loved the chance to have them as is with the lemon provided. Completing everything, we had the dark chocolate tiramisu which (in my opinion) was a perfect way to end.To conclude - the rumors are true. If you're able to get a reservation and have a small fortune saved, you need to have a meal at Osteria Giulia. The best restaurant in Toronto that I've been to, so far.\",\n",

We ordered several dishes to share, and requested some mocktails. Everything came out in a timely manner and was satisfying. My husband's favourite dish was the handbraided pasta, while mine was the ravioli.

I thought I had booked it through OpenTable but it actually didn't go through and we didn't have a reservation. They were nice enough to squeeze us in for the next available table. Ian (?) brought us a snack and a drink on the house while we waited, this definitely lifted our spirits and made our night (Thank you!)We had:Acchiughe e Burro: AKA anchovies and butter on toast. The butter was light and fluffy and the anchovies added saltiness. I'm not a fan of anchovies, but if you are, then you'd LOVE thisFocaccia di Recco: This was a delicacy which is essentially a cheese stuffed flatbread, baked in a copper pan. I didn't find it as special as it sounded when described by our serverCrudo Di Tonno: This yellowtail tuna was served with blood orange and fennel which worked very well together. The orange was juicy and the fennel added aromaSpaghetti al Nero Di Seppia: AKA squid ink spaghetti with a half portion of Nova Scotia Lobster. The pasta was cooked perfectly however the lobster was small and sparse. The flavors were good but this would not be my first pasta pick tbhVitello Tonnato: The veal carpaccio was very tender but a bit salty for me. I'm not sure if it was the albacore tuna or the white sauce (?)Frutti Di Mare Alla Griglia: AKA grilled seafood platter. All the seafood except for the scallop was cooked with lemon and olive oil. The shrimps were overcooked so the shells stuck to the meat. The octopus was overcooked and dry and the other piece of the whitefish seemed frozen. For $50+ I expected alot more in terms of taste and presentationMillefoglie al Pistacio: This was the highlight of the meal for me. The pistachio and raspberry was rich, yet not overly sweet adding nuttiness and fruitinessI realllly wanted to try their egg yolk ravioli and a few more items but they were all sold out by the time we dined (around 10PM). So I would try to book for an earlier time slot if you can. I'll be back soon to try all the items I didn't order!\",\n",

       " [\"TLDR:1. Price Range for most appetizers and pasta between $25~$452. Excellent Customer Service, very attentive and accommodating.3. Conveniently located near Yorkville.4. Excellent selection of pasta, risotto and appetizers.5. Strongly Recommend the grilled octopus, hand braided pasta with squid, and the truffle risotto.Visited Osteria Giulia on Thursday around 5:30PM, the restaurant's seats for two as well as the bar area were already packed. The restaurant uses candles and dim lights to create a relaxing ambience. We started with the Focaccia di Recco, Grilled Octopus and the Veal Carpaccio which were all very well done. However, the Octopus stands out as it was grilled just right so the texture is not rubbery or too bitter, but goes very well with the seaweed butter sauce. For the main, our group of 3 shared the grilled lamb rack, the hand braided pasta with squid, spaghetti with sea urchin, and the truffle risotto. The recommended rarity for the lamb was medium rare which was actually too rare for our liking as it was still pink. We asked the waitress about it and they were able to take it back to make it medium for us. The medium lamb rack was phenomenal as its juicy and a bit crispy outside and pink inside. The hand braided pasta and the truffle risotto were really good. the pasta was very chewy and braided into ring shape to go along with the squid which was entertaining. The risotto had a portion of mushroom and had a strong truffle scent and presence with it.For desserts, we had the tiramisu, a dish with sheep cheese, and a pistachio cake. Unfortunately, the desserts were not as memorable as the appetizers and pasta. The sheep cheese was not what i expected as it was a reasonably sized slice of cheese, with honey comb and a sauce which was actually quite good.All in all, Osteria Giulia is a great place if you are craving for some good pasta and interesting appetizers. It can be somewhat pricey, but still reasonable if you stick with their popular items. The staffs are excellent and the minimum prompt for tips is at 20% which in my honest opinion, is very reasonable since most random eatery in Toronto has a minimum 15% tips prompt. You actually get excellent service at Osteria Giulia which is well justified for the 20% tips.\",\n",

Most places when they have great interior design, I tend to get disappointed with the food. PLANTA surely does not disappoint! I don't eat veggies as much as I should, and I'm surprised that the veggies here doesn't even taste like veggies! We ordered the bang bang broccoli and Japanese  sweet potato for appetizers. All I can say is that they're so delicious! It's an absolute must order! The broccoli was so crispy and the sauce complimented it well. It was like a peanut sweet chilli sauce. The Japanese sweet potato had so much umami flavor! I forgot what the sauce was but it tasted kind of like truffle ! For my main, I ordered the pad Thai slaw with crispy mushroom (extra $4). I was surprised since pad Thai is generally warm. The noodles were cold! I loved the crispy mushrooms! They were savoury and crunchy! I also love the taro chips added on top. As for my friends meals, they ordered the carbonara and the lettuce wraps. Lettuce wrap was with fried tofu and Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were pretty good but heavily doused in sauce. It was also very big portion and my friend couldn't finish it. For the carbonara it tastes exactly like typical carbonara. I'm not sure what they did but it tasted like pork but there were no pork. I would say PLANTA is a  safe choice to try carbonara if you eat halal, since almost every where else has pork in their carbonara. Overall, I really recommend this restaurant! Although it's plant based only, I had a great experience! All the food was good! Only cons were that it is a bit pricey. But nonetheless I think it's great to come occasionally!

       " [\"Carbon bar is where I first fell in love with BBQ. The brisket and ribs are staples and some of the very best you'll find in toronto, and their sides and sauces are amazing which all come together to form a perfect meal. Starting with the venue - it's one of my favourites in the entire city. The ceilings are very high (I imagine this place was once a giant warehouse) which makes for an open, airy ambience with a beautiful bar and great attention to detail in the decor. The drinks are excellent as well - they have an extensive bourbon collection with many classics and harder to find options, and the bourbon cocktail Raised by Wolves is their signature in my opinion, flavored with ancho chili liqueur and undertones of lime and basil. Onto the sides - they have a few classics including: - KFC (korean fried cauliflower) with a lovely spicy korean bbq sauce- mac and cheese was bussin (respectfully) with a lovely chipotle breadcrumb crust on top- coleslaw was perfect, fresh and not too saucy- fries were perfectly crispy - collard greens were great too with lemon and butter Now onto the main event - the best way to go is to get the platter: - Beef brisket and ribs are amazing, both their staples. Their rub / seasoning is bursting with sweet peppery flavor and really hit the spot- Fried chicken was great, had a nice crunch to it although it is quite filling with a thick breading- All their meats are accompanied by a few sauces, the most important being the signature espresso BBQ and the sweet / spicy BBQ. Both sauces combine so well with the meats to form a perfect bite Lastly, we got some banoffee pie for dessert! The pie came with a vanilla chantilly and banana brittle with bourbon caramel, it was the perfect way to end a heavy meal with something light and sweet.Overall, I'd say this is the best spot in the city to come for BBQ food, and a perfect place to have a big sit down dinner with friends and drinks. It's been a staple of mine for years and a perfect meal every time.\",\n",

This is a Texas BBQ joint, a cuisine I haven\\'t really ever explored. To start, the interior is really classy and modern looking, and a lot bigger than it looks on the outside. Their Summerlicious menu consists of 3 courses. For the appetizer, I chose the caesar salad which came as two big chunks of lettuce that you cut up to make your salad. It sounds weird but I actually enjoyed it! The other options were salmon tartare and a mini birria quesadilla, which my friends both opted for - and they said both were good. For our main, we all chose the same thing: the pit platter, so the kitchen put all of our orders together on a huge platter (as the name suggests). There was enough for everyone to get two ribs, two slices of beef brisket, and more than a spoonful of pulled pork each. They had three \"hot\" sauces that I think are made in-house (?) but none of them were really that hot. As for the meat, the ribs were really tender and fell off the bone. They paired really well with the sweet \\'n spicy sauce offered. The brisket was my favourite; the flavour was so good and it paired well with the espresso hot sauce. And finally, I\\'m not a huge fan of pulled pork, but theirs wasn\\'t too bad. My dessert was the coconut creme pie and the coconut was super overpowering. I wish I had gotten the banoffie pie - it had a great texture and was much more pleasant to eat than the dry coconut. The service was quick and the manager/owner even stopped by at one point to give us a lil\\' history lesson on the building and the story of The Carbon Bar.

We took the burden of decisions off our hands and selected \"the experience\", which is a curated meal. A couple of starters, a seafood item, salad, then the platter (which you can get on its own), and dessert for the finish. The pie, which I wish I could remember the name of, was decadent and I could eat a whole bowl of that. Even after eating all that heavy heavy meat.

I\\'d recommend you find a plush chair with a cigar to let your gut do it\\'s job.Our server was nice, helpful, and an all round great person.

Excellence perspires through every plate that comes out of that kitchen, and the attention to detail is immaculate. They start you off with their warm bread and butter. The bread is fluffy and crusty all at once, with a lovely herby butter that is dangerously good. Some of the best bread and butter I've ever had, and you're off to a good start. The apps are great across the board, but there's nothing better than the caesar salad. It is bar none, the best salad I have ever had in my life, perfectly dressed and with a mouth-watering combination of textures and flavours in every bite. The seafood is also very good, I especially enjoy their oysters and jumbo shrimp, which are absolutely massive. At this point it's hard not to be full, but the meat is the main event. I recommend getting one of the bigger lower grade steaks to fill up on, with an Aussie wagyu and a Japanese wagyu to taste. The Japanese wagyu is like eating butter, it just melts on your tongue. The Aussie wagyu is my favourite - slightly less fatty but with immense character in the flavours. As for the rest of the steaks, they're all solid, but one bite of the wagyu and it's hard to go back to the regular stuff. When it comes to dessert, everything is solid but not mind blowing. They send you home with a chocolate chip muffin which I usually like to save for breakfast, and it's easily the best muffin I've had in my life. Overall, this place is definitely worth it - it is easily one of the best steakhouses / meals I've had in my life, and consistently blows me away every time I try it.\",\n",

It might've been the highlight of the meal if the steaks weren't so good. Something about seeing all the individual ingredients come together in front of you and then eating the final product was amazing. In terms of the stakes, I feel like you can't go wrong with any of the cuts. Both steaks we got were perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare. We didn't get any Wagyu, but next time we will for sure. It was my first time eating steak with some of the sauces that were provided, and my favourite was the blue cheese.

I think its pretty pricey since parking in dt toronto drops after 6pm, if you want to save some money, look for parking near the area!Once you walk in, you will see the reception. It was a bit overwhelming for me, the waitress/serves were standing in a straight line, not talking, and looking at you. Felt a bit uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy this kind of service, i just felt like there were just way too many people standing and looking at you. We were seated on the second floor. First floor is the bar area and where the pianist performed. Second floor decor was very fancy but minimal, love it. We were seated by the window. The server came by, greeted and went over the menu with us. Do not hesitate to ask them if you have any questions, they are more then welcome to assist you and give you suggestions.We ordered 2 drinks. Both very strong in alcohol flavors and less juicy or soday. Im not much of a drinker, so that was a bit too strong for me.The bread came after. Huge, fresh, crispy but soft in the side. Looks like a muffin with a huge mushroom head. Love the bread. WISH there was more. The salad came after. The caesar salad is made on the spot in front of you. I love the presentation but flavours wise, it tasted a bit too vinegar and lemony to me. Its not bad, but i had better 3/5. The steak and the sides came. We ordered the 30 days aged striploin from USA in medium. I felt like the exterior of the steak was a bit burnt, made the steak more on the chewy side. I love how they have 6 different condiments for the steak, recommend the soya sauce and the pink salt. Overall 4/5. The mushroom risotto smelt super mushroomy and cheesy. Smell and appearance is 5/5. I just wished it was more creamy, the rice was a bit on the chewy side, maybe a minute or 2 longer in the sauce can make it softer and creamer. Still not bad! 4.5/5!We ordered 2 sides, and the server recommended we do half side, which we did and super grateful because we were so full after. We had the Sauteed Rapini (the green leaves vegetable) and the potato grantin (potato sliced, and layered in cream and cheese). The rapini have some heat to it, its alright, nothing too too special 3/5. The potato was DELICIOUS, if you love cheese and cream, this is the dish for you! Super cheesy, flavourful, cripsy on the top, soft in the inside. 5/5!Last but not lease, the dessert was a chocolate pudding, whipped cream with crushed chocolate and oeros on the top and bottom. I love dessert but not a fan of desserts that are too sweet. I thought this would be way too sweet for me, but it was in a perfect balance between sweetness and chewiness. LOVE IT! Just wish there was more. 5/5.They even give you a small chocolate brownie, a cookie and 2 muffins when you ask for the bill. I was too full to even try the muffin. But overall, the experience was great. I just wish the steak was more tender and juicy and the caesar salad can be less sour or vinegary. Overall 8.5/5',\n",

And the chickpea fritters were the perfect accompaniment, with just the right amount of crunch and a delicious sauce that had my taste buds dancing with joy. The short rib and sunchokes were delicious, but the beef was definitely a bit overcooked.The attention to detail in every dish was simply incredible. Each plate was a work of art that tasted just as good as it looked. I could tell that the chefs had put a lot of thought and care into every element, from the presentation to the flavors and textures.And I have to give a special shoutout to the service team at Rasa.

The iberico pork itself had a great taste, but the plate as a whole wasn't as inspired as some of the other dishes. Every cocktail is a 10/10. TRY THEM ALL haha.

We were served by Ken who was extremely attentive, accomodating as well as knowledgeable about each dish. It was also interesting to find out that the plateware was made by an employee who got into pottery and also engraved a thank you in a different language. The chopped salad was consistent with the last time, though i honestly dont remember grapes being in there the last time (according to my partner). The rainbow trout was a nice crispy skin and done very well. My partner found the onion's a tad too salty though, but was perfectly good to me.Rasa burger was a bit smaller than I remember, but it also came previously in a cast iron pan. It was juicy and good, though the bun did soak a bit too much juice at the bottom.The kitchen is super efficient. Like all our food came out in under 15 minutes. Would have liked to have a bit of time to digest in between courses, but i rather it come too fast than too late. The amuse bouche was very good and a great opening. They did actually honor the free sticky bun from my past review, despite the time skip. Greatly appreciated everything and was pleased with the dinner.

Also, this place is rather small, so keep your party size to no more than 6 or else it's going to be difficult unless you make reservations in advance.I would strongly recommend going for at least 1 of each of their courses. (Appetizer, Entree, dessert). They do have a fried donut for $5, but we were full by the end of it, so we didn't get it.The chopped salad has received rave reviews from other people and I'd like to chime in that if there was a salad that I could go eat on a daily basis, this would be it (no becoming vegetarian thoughts yet). The chickpeas were a nice addition and the portion size was good. It was well-balanced and you can taste the fresh and the crunch with each bite. On a preference issue, it was somewhat hard to get the salad from the big bowl (presentation = beautiful btw) with a fork and then eat from the plate with the fork. I would have liked to use chopsticks. There was also a bacon dish that I probably should've taken, but I had salad.I had the burger for a main dish and my partner had the albacore tuna dish. Burger was smaller than I thought it would be, but was more filling than I expected. The burger meat was...so soft and juicy. I can still salivate on that memory even though I just ate lunch. The albacore tuna dish was tasty (of the small portion that I had). The dessert was a chocolate mousse. I would say that this was probably not the most satisfying way to end the meal, simply because it was the size of a chocolate truffle. To be perfectly fair, it was way better than any truffle I've tasted because it was so soft, smooth and creamy. It also helped that it simply melted instantly in your mouth.All in all, great meal. The ambiance inside the restaurant was great, not too loud or too soft, and the live music was a nice romantic touch. I couldn't figure out the beat because I suck, but my partner could, and that's all that mattered. Service was good and not overbearing. I did like the waiters' accents, they were cool.Service: 5/5Food: 5/5Price Point: 4.5/5 (I feel that it's still a tad too pricey, but everything was a bullseye)Overall: 5/5Note: They do NOT open on saturdays for brunch (they open at 5:30PM).

I liked that it was away from the rest of the patrons and therefore more private for us.We decided to share the Miku Waterfront Platter which was good. I liked the variety and presentation. We also ordered a ton of sharing plates: the Aonori Tempura Calamari which was decent. The Salmon Oshi is my favourite (I always order this when I\\'m here), the Spicy Sesame Edamame was ok, Crispy Brussel Sprouts are also a favourite and something I always order, and the Aburi Beef Carpaccio was great.I had the AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib which was excellent. The meat was really tender and delicious. The Kaisen Soba Pepperoncino tasted great as well.As for the birthday desserts, we had a scoop of sorbet with a lit candle and \"Happy Birthday\" neatly written. It was really cute and I loved it! We ordered some dessert to share: the Green Tea Opera is my favourite and something I order every time, the Japanese Peach Elba is something I wouldn\\'t order again, and the Ichigo Velvet Mochi Dome was okay.The service was fantastic as always, and I always have a good time here.',\n",

I like to hate on it just a bit, because it was trying too hard when it first started up.On my visit here to this location in Toronto, I had a really great time. Food was good and service was good. My only complaint is perhaps that the hostess did a poor job of seating us. We had to ask for a better table. It is a pet peeve of mine that a restaurant does not give you the best seat in the house, if it is available. I know restaurants want to spread their customers across the sections evenly, for the sake of the servers, but that's not the customer's problem to care about.Just always give your paying customers the best seat in the house.\",\n",

Ordered the takowasa ($9), tori karaage ($15), ebi mayo ($15) and mochi bacon ($7.5) along with the nama grapefruit ($12) and yuzu soda ($15) cocktails. Personal favorites were the ebi mayo and mochi bacon. The ebi mayo was actually very well done, large prawns with a bit of spice. Probably wouldn't get the karaage again since it just lacked flavour (even with the mayo). But everything else was pretty average. Jack of all trades kind of place.Strictly on food it'd be 3 stars but the cocktails I thought were really nice, light and easy to drink, making it a 4 star for me. They didn't really mix it when it got to the table but after a stir the flavors are great.

The main course was even better, had the fried chicken special, which was an Asian style chicken breast served that you wrapped in lettuce with a side sauce. It was so good I kept debating whether to use the also good sauce because I loved the flavour without it.  I also truly enjoyed the fried squash, which was indescribably good.

This is one of their menu highlights. It looks like a plain half a head of lettuce with some toppings, but actually has a delicious and light, creamy dressing that permeates through the layers. There is a thin layer of avocado and a layer of crisped rice and seeds that give a satisfying and hearty touch! Lamb ragu - good, a hearty tomato sauce with meaty cubes of lamb. Burger and fries - fries were very good. Note that you get a huge portion. The burger was requested to be cooked to medium, but it was almost well done. It was very good regardless, but could have been better. Came with a thick layer of torched cheese. Lemon meringue pie - a huge portion! We shared and still couldn't finish.

As for the food, we ordered 4 things including the tuna tartare with uni, lamb ragu pappardelle and the grilled octopus. The octopus was cooked perfectly and I liked the sauce, it was flavorful but I wish I had a carb to balance it out. The pappardelle was cooked very nicely and I loved how the lamb complemented it. The lamb was tender but also a little crispy which gave the dish another level of texture. The tuna tartare and uni was good but it was a tad fishy for my liking.As for drinks, I loved that they were served in a chilled glass.

I typically don't get excited about a salad (especially with iceberg lettuce) but this dish was the highlight of our meal! It was a unique and well-balanced combination in terms of flavours and textures. The burger was excellent, but nothing super memorable. The olive appetizer was a delicious standout as well! The only disappointment of the night was the lemon meringue pie, although I should preface that I'm not a huge fan of lemon desserts.

We did make a mistake of having a \"pre dinner\" so we weren\\'t as hungry as we thought we would (I was eyeing the burger beforehand but ultimately knew i couldn\\'t finish it). We ended up just ordering the foie gras, beef tartare and the pineapple rum sundae. We were told the foie gras is not the typical savoury pate, but more on the sweet end. I enjoyed it with the toast but I think I would\\'ve liked it with a bit more bread to balance out the sweetness since there was some maple syrup on it as well. The beef tartare was really good! Potato chips were house made and not overly salty so we could really enjoy the tartare. I found it nice for texture that they also had pinenuts in it. Finally the pineapple rum sundae was delicious, pineapples were the hidden gem at the bottom and the tartness cut through the sweetness of the ice cream!

It was so much better than any other steak I've had. Although it did get too fatty in some bites, to the point where I chugged my entire mocktail, I didn't notice the wasabi at first, but once I did, it changed the taste in the most delightful way.As for the Lemongrass & Limequat, it was refreshing and light, and I simply adored it. The Mont Blanc Petit fours were a little too sweet for my taste, but the coffee balanced it out.

My favourite bite was the smoked salmon with caviar. The tart crust was so crispy, the salmon was very fresh and the caviar was a great pop of flavour. 1. Hokkaido Scallop - these were the best scallops I've had! Super fresh with a hint of sweetness. The zesty sauce was a great compliment. 2. Wagyu & Oyster - one of my favourite bites of the night. The wagyu was so buttery. I usually don't enjoy raw oyster, but this was very fresh. The 2 purées were refreshing and light. Excellent balance to the buttery wagyu. 3. Shima-aji - these sashimi slices were so fresh. The spot of yuzu really brought out the natural flavour of the fish. 4. East Coast Lobster - thoroughly enjoyed this dish as well. The lobster was springy and sweet. The uni was very creamy with a light salty flavour. The egg based sauce added to the creaminess of the dish. This was a very filling and comforting dish. 5. Koshihikari Rice - this dish resembled a risotto. Loved the mushrooms used. The rice itself was slightly on the saltier side. 6. Swordfish - very unique chewy texture. Loved the flavour of the spicy peppers and sauce. 7. Pecking duck - very tender and flavourful. The purée was an amazing complement to the meaty flavour of the duck. Be sure to eat them together! 8. Provimi Veal Tenderloin - this tasted so much better than it looked. It was one of the most tender steaks I've had. The light salt brings out the natural flavour of the meat. Don't skip out on the eggplant purée! It was an excellent complement to the veal if you wanted a stronger smoky flavour. I should also shoutout the butter milk bread, so soft and buttery! 9. Dessert 1 - love the chestnut praline topping. Inside the chocolate dome contained ice cream and meringue. A delightful dessert with many textures and flavours. 10. Petit Fours - contained yuzu Madeline, chocolate tart. Chocolate rum Choux, and Canelé. This was my first time having Canelé and I absolutely loved it!

Our meal was 11 courses with the option to add an additional course. There were 2 wine pairings to choose from, a regular and premium one. We opted to have one regular pairing and share as we're not much of wine drinkers.During the meal they started off every course with a brief explanation of the dish. If there was a wine pairing for the course the wine would come first with an explanation as well. In between courses our utensils were changed as well.All the courses were really good.

       " [\"After having wanted to try this place for a couple of years, my husband managed to book a table for my birthday. I'd rate Alo 3.5 stars if I could. We had 6 course tasting menu and 2 glasses of white wine. We were seated at a table on the third floor behind the bar counter, which was a bit squ eezy. (he said a table in only this zone was  available when booking). I wish we sat at a table on the second floor which looks more spacious. The course started with sashimi, following foie gras tart, and risotto.  All the dishes were beautifully presented and incorporated unique Japanese ingredients and flavours. After the three dishes, we were served scallops and a steak. Both were nicely cooked, tender and came with flavorful sauce. The course finished with an assorted dessert which included crepe cake, ice cream, macaron, canele, and caramel. All the dishes were good but not mind-blowing. The bill came to 375 dollars including tips. So I'm not sure if the dinner was worth the price to be honest.\",\n",

       " ['I\\'ve wanted to come here for a while, and what better occasion than to celebrate a friend\\'s birthday? The service here is excellent and the food pretty good (some courses more delicious than others)... but I\\'m not entirely sure I\\'d eat here again with the $185 price tag.Service was impeccable - every time I took a single sip of my drink, it was immediately replaced. I don\\'t think my drink was ever less than 3/4ths full! They asked if we wanted champagne to start but we opted for other drinks instead. I got a cocktail, one with bloody orange, and my friend got a glass of light-bodied red wine.We started off with canapés and bread. There was venison tartare, parmesan biscuit with portobello, and a tartlette. The venison wasn\\'t gamey at all - the flavour from the shaved truffle wasn\\'t too strong and there was a healthy dose of mustard. The toasted rice added a nice crunch too! The parmesan biscuit reminded me of a fancy Ritz cracker while the tartlette was a touch too salty but very creamy. The bread (brioche-like) was so good! It was sufficiently salty with a buttery flake. Next came the seafood course. The east coast oyster tasted fresh but not too fishy thanks to the tarragon oil. It was like a starburst of flavour - fruity, light, and refreshing. The kinmedai was lightly torched, with miso and yuzu dressing. You could taste the citrusy essence from the yuzu. The bluefin tuna toro pastry cigar with caviar was quickly devoured - it was a great juxtaposition between the crunchy, crispy pastry and the smooth, buttery toro. The salty caviar helped balance all the flavours. There was an egg dish not dissimilar from chawanmushi with an Alaskan king crab and cured quail yolk on the bottom. This was the richer and heavier dish of the four, and we were advised to eat it last (in order from light to heaviest). The egg mousse tasted like the sea and the king crab was so sweet - but I forgot to properly mix the dish and ended up biting into a very salty quail yolk.The foie gras came next - frankly speaking, I generally find foie gras to be too heavy and rich. Alo\\'s rendition was very interesting. The foie gras was the filling of a \"rhubarb pie\"; the rhubarb came in multiple forms (freeze dried, cream, compote) and helped alleviate the richness of the foie gras. It was a melange of flavours and textures, as has been the theme thus far, the fresh celery, tangy coating, and pickles cut the butteriness, the pastry tart was slightly sweet, but I disliked the bitterness of some of the cured rhubarbs.We slowly moved into the heavier courses, starting off with the koshihikari rice. It came in the form of a risotto, served with porcini mushrooms in a dashi broth. The puffed rice helped add some texture to the otherwise soft dish, and there was a subtle citrus taste that balanced the earthiness.The Spanish dover sole came next, crusted in panko crumbs and in a soup like creamy broth. This was my least favourite dish - the sole was too soft, and it was a weird mix of flavours. The flavour profile was mostly bland with the exception of the olives (which added a peculiar punch) and a lemon foam. The BC mussels also seemed out of place...The Pekin duck was presented soon after, and it was delicious! The roasted meat was warm, hearty, and the sweet white chocolate dressing played the role of the plum sauce typically seen. The savoury Ferrero rocher was intriguing but I still have no idea what was on the inside!The New Zealand lamb rack was another interesting take on Asian cuisine. It was a perfect medium rare and, though well seasoned and grilled, was a great partner for the Thai green curry. This dish was one of the highlights for sure!The lamb rounded out the savoury part of the meal and we moved onto the sweet. A black sesame biscuit encompassing a blood orange sorbet and sake jelly was presented. This was mediocre - I didn\\'t find that the flavour combo worked at all. The sesame was a bit earthy, nutty, gritty, and the sake flavour overpowered at first.The desserts, which rounded out the meal, were a delight! The apple tartin served on a pastry with a butterscotch custard was good, but I personally found it too sweet and rich. It was served warm, which was a nice contrast to the ice cold, tangy, refreshing Granny Smith sorbet. The gingerbread profiterole was decadent and reminded me of a warm hug with the cinnamon and nutmeg flavours. Then came the petit fours; the chocolate s\\'mores had a great chewy texture from the marshmallow, the grapefruit truffle was citrusy and slightly bitter, the macaron was well-executed but not terribly memorable, and the passion fruit caramel was extremely fruity and fresh!I\\'d told the servers it was my friend\\'s birthday and they also brought out a sprinkle birthday cake on the house, with a candle and all! It was so sweet.If you\\'re looking to splurge on a special occasion, this is the place to go. It is quite pricey, so may be a looooong while till I attend again.',\n",

       " [\"We went to Alo tonight and sat at the kitchen table tasting.  Overall, I say their dishes were on point and I did enjoy the evening.  If there was only one negative, it would be the wine service.  I ordered an old fashion to start the night, then I choose to order a Pinot from burgundy off the menu, instead of doing their wine pairing.  Since I prefer red wine over white, and the wine pairing was predominantly white.I enjoyed the wine that I did get, but it was unfortunate that I didn't get the bottle opened till we were already 3-4 course into our meal.Their 'famous' sommelier, Christoper, nice guy, maybe too friendly, seems to focus too much on diners doing the wine pairings, and totally negated peeps that order bottles. I still have like 1/3 of the bottle when we got to dessert, since it was opened so late into our service.  At least they packed the bottle up for take home.I found out later that do they allow corkage at $80 a bottle.  If that is their usual wine service for ordering bottles, I should've just brought my own bottle from my cellar.\",\n",

       " ['With the highly coveted reservations already secured by a friend, I had absolutely no reason to decline an invitation to dinner at one of the most renowned fine dining restaurants in Toronto, perhaps even in Canada. I\\'ve had Aloette in the past and absolutely loved their menu so I was very excited to see what Alo had to offer. Asides from the rather.. interesting elevator ride up to the restaurant, which arguably felt like we were entering a speakeasy from how covert and dingy the elevator was, the overall restaurant experience was impeccable, a true reflection of fine dining. From the way the courses were meticulously served around table symmetry to the rotation and pairing of utensils for each individual dish, there was no detail that was missed. Even our lap napkins were replaced with fresh ones when we left our seats for the restroom.I have a lot of appreciation for the artistry and vision behind Chef Patrick Kriss\\' creation of our particular blind 9-course tasting menu (Sep 4, 2021). However, I was rather unimpressed by the execution of the Japanese-fusion twist and I had rather wished for the opportunity to experience authentic \"modern French cuisine\". Now hear me out, Japanese cuisine is undeniably my favourite cuisine of all time so perhaps my expectation for anything \"Japanese fusion\" was set too high. There\\'s no doubt that Alo used Japanese elements and ingredients of the highest caliber in each of the courses, but I felt that the flavours of the two cuisines just didn\\'t marry well. The appetizers and desserts, along with the foie gras tart, were mostly misses for me. Two of the appetizers that were served back to back, the burrata and the sea urchin egg yolk foam were both incredibly and overwhelmingly salty, with the latter taking away from the natural sweetness of fresh uni. The toro was served negitoro style, which from an aesthetics and palatability point of view felt inferior to what could\\'ve been an actual slice of toro. The foie gras, I can only comment that I found the yellow plum pairing far too tangy and tart. Even at the thought of it now, my face puckers. As I am not a foie gras connoisseur, I will share my friend\\'s positive review that it was \"very smooth\". And the petit fours, the six unique desserts that acted as the finale to the meal, were all very exciting to witness being laid out on a table all at once in front of us, but didn\\'t entice me all that much. Personally, I would\\'ve much preferred either a full traditional French tasting menu OR a full traditional Japanese tasting menu. Not a fusion that doesn\\'t do justice to either - that\\'s just my two cents.Now onto the dishes that really stole the spotlight for me - my three favourites in descending order were the amadai, scallop, and wagyu (+$85 in replacement of lamb). The culinary skill behind the amadai was absolutely incredible - a buttery and tender filet of fish lightly flash-fried on its backside to create crispy edible skin and scales. The jumbo scallop was my second favourite because it was also buttery and tender and served with a delicious umami crab bisque. The wagyu comes third because I thought it was an additional course for $85 rather than a replacement (couldn\\'t hear the waiter well behind face masks). As well, my piece unfortunately had a lot of tendon. For the rest of my table, everyone commented that the wagyu was a perfect melt-in-your-mouth experience, but my piece was chewy. All in all, I felt that my tasting menu at Alo was very creative and used some very bold flavour choices. While I personally did not love every dish that was served, I can appreciate the careful thought and design that went into each recipe. Seeing as my favourite courses were mostly entrees, I would probably opt for the a la carte menu rather than the tasting menu next time, should there be one. I\\'m happy to say now that I\\'ve \"been there, done that\" but I wouldn\\'t be inclined to say that I would definitely be back.',\n",

So defs recommend making resos, esp if coming after work. Off the Summerlicious menu I ordered the Caesar salad as my app, Carmela's Bolognese as my main and the mini New York cheesecake as my dessert.  My friend had also ordered a margherita pizza for the table to share.  I ordered a frozen mango margarita, as well. The margarita was delicious, esp with the salted rim.  You can defs taste the alcohol lol.Once again, everything I ordered was outstanding.  The salad was soooo good.  It was dressed perfectly, like literally just the perfect amount of dressing, which was great.  The parm crisps added texture and saltiness, making the whole salad come together.The Bolognese took me by surprise.  It's not like any other bolognese I've ever tried before, which I liked!  It was different in a delicious way.  The sauce clung to the noodles just right and the meat was tender and minced in a way that it also clung to the noodles and sauce.  The portion was big enough for me to take home half. This is also probably because we had the pizza lol which by the way was also great.  Really no complaints about it.The mini cheesecake dessert actually wasn't so small and just the perfect amount to end off a three course meal.  Again, cheesecake was exactly what a cheesecake should taste like with a perfect graham cracker crust.Honestly, so surprised with how good the food was.

They had a green one that was medium spicy and the red one which was actually quite spicy -- I teared up a little. These tacos are absolutely huge and I would say two of them is around the amount of a very solid meal. It was packed with meat and served on a thin tortilla that surprisingly held up well.

My family and I were in Toronto a few years ago and had a lovely, delicious dinner at Beer Bistro. The quality of the food and service were excellent. The beer selection and pairings were creative and delicious. There was just one problem: the Pulled Pork Primanti is just wrong, wrong wrong. Coming from Pittsburgh, even as a non-native born, I can tell you that what they are offering doesn't credit our city or culture. A sandwich from Primanti Brothers should be on thick, soft italian bread with meat, slaw and a generous helping of fries. The meat should be cappicola, roast beef, kielbasa, corned beef (among other). What they are offering at Beer Bistro is a pulled pork dripping with sauce. The slaw is de minimus as are the fries. And the bun, while freshly baked, is just not right. Also, the hot pepper should be replaced with hot sauce. Conclusion: I'd go back, but I won't order this again. I suggest the chef take a trip south of the border and do some research!\",\n",

The tap list is amazing and there are also many bottles to choose from, as well as wines and other cocktails. Not only is the booze great, but the food is not an afterthought! My husband and I split the Belgian frites and duck salad and we each got a butternut squash soup. My mouth is watering just thinking about all of it! The fries were plentiful (so many fries!!) and super tasty but not greasy at all. They were served with mayo and smoked ketchup and I just couldn't get enough. Then the duck salad came and it was the perfect combination of flavors, plus the duck was cooked perfectly. When I thought I might burst, the butternut squash soup came and it was so delicious that I devoured every mouthful. It actually tasted like butternut squash and was not overly seasoned or salted. The waitstaff are always top notch and even when it's busy I never feel abandoned. My only minor complaint was that they stopped serving gluten free pizza but never took it off the menu.

The server didn't ask how I liked it cooked, so I thought perhaps there's no choices when it comes to cooking veal lol.

My friend said the same for the ribs.For dessert, I tried the blueberry bread pudding with ice-cream.  The ice-cream had a rough texture and it was very mild in taste.

Great meal experience overall. This place gets high accolades (it also appears on the Michelin guide honourable mentions), and it did not disappoint. Food: 5/5========The food is most delicious. Each dish was well-thought-out. You can tell that they are serious about their food, as they have a big open gallery kitchen that is teaming with activity. Here's what we got:Smoked fish appetizer - $16. Most delicious spread. Very smokey. Was served with super thin potato chips. At first I thought it was weird to have a chip instead of a cracker, but it actually worked beautifully. Must try dish. Kampachi - $22 - delicious crudo. Must try. Celery root salad - $18 - very nice. Cauliflower - $18 - very nice.Skate - $35 - very delicious. Was very rich, like a braised beef. Five Spice Cake - $12. Yum! I LOVE five spice, and the cake did the spice mix justice. One complaint I had was that the cocktail list was basically non-existent. The one cocktail I tried (Bitter Spritz 18$) was not great (diluted, sweet and no bitters). The wine options were very expensive. I opted for the Saison beer (Burdock Tuesday $9), and I was not disappointed. Service: 4/5=========The service was mostly friendly, but a little lukewarm. The server knew the dishes very well, and was able to remember the options by heart. Very casual style of service overall (complete with hipster scruffy outfits), which is somewhat nice, and at the same time leaves you wanting a little more  warmth and elegance. Ambiance: 5/5============The ambiance overall is very nice. Let's start with the fact that the restaurant is located in hipster-central: Kensington Market. At the same time, it's definitely elevated for the neighbourhood. The place is very casual, but not without elegance. The decor is grungy, but not without style. The lights are nice and dim. It's definitely warm and rather romantic. You could definitely come here on a first date. The playlist was amazing. I kept wanting to Shazam the songs.

I appreciate that they were able to accommodate us but next time will be sure to make a reservation for more comfortable visit. The bar area was cool but very little space. On to the food- We ordered the Ackee and Saltfish bites- all my years of eating Jamaican cuisine and never tried the fish. I was most def missing out. Jerk chicken- although this is top fav, I can easily go without but this chicken was worth the try. It was breast I believe but very juicy and flavorful. Oxtail- very flavorful. Great gravy to match and good Chucky pieces. Red beans and rice- the only thing I was not feeling. The rice was a little to dry for my taste even when adding the oxtail gravy. Would most definitely come back and highly recommend for anyone visiting the area. bring this to the bay hehehhe\",\n",

Great flavors for both with the appropriate spice levels. Only complaint is that the portions are 1/3 of what I'm use to in the suburbs at almost double the price.

Both were DELICIOUS and paired well with the charcuterie platter.SMOKED CHOCOLATE MOUSSE: This one was not a favourite.  The presentation was very cool - it came out in a glass dome filled with smoke, and they lifted the dome at the table so the smoke dispersed into the air.

Antler has faced a lot of controversy, yet that doesn't stop them from dishing out delicious meats that you won't be able to experience anywhere else. We came with a group of 3 and a reservation on Sunday at 7:00 PM. The restaurant was packed and there is little to no waiting space available in the cozy restaurant, so expect to wait a little bit outside if you come early. Make sure you book a reservation online before coming here!Once we were seated, we quickly ordered our appetizers and entrees. For our appetizers, we got the wild mushroom tart and their specialty bread to share + duck liver parfait. For the entrees, I got the bison rib-eye - an ambitious dinner given its immense size.Wild Mushroom Tart: Wildly delicious! Highly recommend this if you love mushrooms. It was perfectly flakey and buttery and filled to the brim with an assortment of delicious mushrooms. The sorrel pesto that accompanied it was delicious too. When I come back, I'll be ordering this again. Specialty Bread with maple butter and duck liver parfait: a cheap appetizer that is simple yet delicious. The bread was perfectly crusty and soft, but I absolutely loved the maple butter that it came with! The duck liver parfait with the rosemary bread was also really delicious.Bison Rib-eye: delicious and a huge portion - I would share this with my boyfriend next time because it was simply too much for me to eat by myself. The mushrooms and polenta were a compliment to the bison which was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The charred broccoli was a bit too bitter for my liking, but they're very generous with the portion size.We finished off dessert with the Ontario Pear Semifreddo. This was probably the one thing I wouldn't get again. It was way too overly sweet despite the perfectly poached pear. I would advise getting something else - it was quite disappointing. I'd opt for the smoked chocolate mousse the next time I come back.Service was phenomenal from start to finish. The staff were so polite and attentive! My glass was never empty and they get an extra point for splitting the bill for our shared appetizers! I'll definitely be returning to try something else.\",\n",

For those that have never dined at George\\'s, they offer two options, they have an \"a la carte,\" menu which includes 5 standard courses with food of your choice. They also offer a 5, 7, or 10 course tasting menu (as well as a wine pairing). For party\\'s over 2, the chef will prepare 2 different meals (so in our case with 4 people, 2 people go the same thing), We all chose the 5 course menu... To begin, the servers ask if you have any dietary restrictions, or preferences. One person from our party chose to not include beef or pork in their courses, and instead opt for seafood. The first course is a seafood course, second is the \"foie gras,\" course which include fois gras and another type of meat. Third was the main course, our party received venison, ribeye, and halibut for the meat of our main, then comes cheese, and finally dessert.My first course was a hamachi dish (type of tuna) served with roasted carrots. This was served raw, but nevertheless it was delicious. The second course include foie gras, pork tenderloin, and a toasted crisp on top. The main course, my favorite course, consisted of the most flavorful, tender, venison, potatoes, artichokes, and a decadent sauce. Our cheese course consisted of a delicious goat cheese, crackers, and a raspberry jam. Our last course, dessert, as extraordinary... we were celebrating two birthdays that night, which our waitress knew after chatting with us, and due to that, the wonderful staff wrote \"happy birthday,\" on both of our plates! Other than that the pana cotta was deliciously creamy and rich, with the most light lemon curd on the side.The service here was exceptional, there was dozens of waiters and servers that were constantly making the experience more enjoyable! The waiters/waitresses also did a wonderful job explaining each course, which is impressive considering the menu changes daily!  The ambiance of the restaurant was also fantastic! There atmosphere was casual, romantic, and sophisticated. The location for this restaurant was also perfect! The last topic I would like to talk in this review was the price. I thought that the price was reasonable for the meals, but, I do believe that the price of bread or sparkling water, was a bit excessive.

They also offered tasting menu options at this restaurant with 5, 7, 10 courses at different prices.We ordered a basket of bread (with a few varieties) for sharing before appetizers were served. It was gone so quickly. My boy ate so much. They also provided each of us a spoon of tasteful vegetable.Now the food we ordered: - Wagyu was sooooo yummy. Very soft and tender. Melted in my mouth immediately.- Tuna tartare: I could hardly figure out it was tuna tartare by just looking at the dish. The tuna was wrapped in a layer of crispy filling, which looked more like a crab cake. It was so perfectly flavoured. A dish full of creativity and surprise.- Scallop: topped with some leafy vegetable salad. Yummy as usual.- Gnocchi and halibut were good too, although not the best I've ever had.- Beef ribeye: impressive dish again. They have really good cut for the beef here.- Cow's Cheese platter with pears: I can never say no to cheese, especially when they were paired with refreshing pears.- Chocolate Basque cake: Good but not wowing.Overall, there was no dish that was not good here. The most impressive dishes were the beef, the tuna tartare and the wagyu. The service was okay too but not meeting Michelin standard yet. Maybe that's why they didn't get one star, but I'll give them one if I can! I can imagine this restaurant to be my top recommendation place for special event.\",\n",

We noticed that other tables had a sommelier assist in their wine options, and we were left wondering where the choice was to have that service added to the experience as our server didn't mention it.The restaurant was full booked with no empty tables and plenty of staff running around trying their best to keep up. They did a great job of keeping us happy and without any real distractions allowing us to enjoy the experience and each others company.The 5-course dinner and drinks were brought out at a nice pace with only an occasional lull over the entire time we ate. The table was booked for 8 pm on a Saturday, and I had also booked at a lounge for after dinner thinking 10:30 pm but we didn't make it until almost midnight so keep that in mind for planning your evening.The 5 courses were a perfect way to experience George. The variety was good and the amount of food was perfect. It didn't occur to us that the 7 courses would have been any advantage. Presentation was beautiful, and it felt nice having each course include an appropriate table setting. This was all done without us being distracted and having to break and lose focus on the conversation. That alone made our evening at George memorable and well appreciated. The description of each course from our server was difficult to understand as it was spoken too quickly, included a fair number of words to parse (each person gets different items), and of course the mask didn't help. It would have been better if they had the items written down to help us appreciate the ingredients better.We had a couple cocktails each which were very good! Careful as these full size cocktails can be very strong and the first one I had went straight to my head. Also keep in mind the restaurant is fairly large and thus had some moments with a chilly breeze where we sat, likely from the door opening.Overall George was a fantastic experience and made me super happy with my choice for a memorable occasion evening out.\",\n",

That was followed by an excellent ricotta gnocchi in tomato sauce.   The main I chose was salmon with perogie and brusssels, and I definitely did NOT have ordering envy.  The salmon was cooked beautifully with a crisp outer layer, and the accompaniments really played well together.  Finished off with a seasonal fruit plate, which was super fresh and delicious.

Tasty, rich broth, nicely cooked noodles and even though the egg went last, it was still firmly cooked and a little soft from the hot broth. Delicious.They do have bottled and draft beer, I had a 16 ounce pint of Sapporo.A big bowl of soup, well loaded with pork, nori and scallions.

Typically I expect ramen broth to be thick and heavy whereas the broth here is light with a faint sweetness.I got the pork original -- why not go with the mainstay on a first visit -- and some chicken karaage. The noodles were thin and with bite. The ramen was hot, came out quick and was filling and delicious. The only knock I have is that the egg was cold in the center which was disappointing. Why not cut the egg and let the broth heat it?  It's what I did and all was good after some fixing. The chicken thighs were enough for two to share. Fried crispy and delicious. I got the hot / spicy version which had a sweet-hot sticky sauce on it.  IMO ask for sauce on the side. Pro tip:  Ask for some dry chili flakes to step up the punchiness if you're into that.\",\n",

For the price, we would not get it again but it was definitely juicy and well marbled beef. Next time, I'd like to try the grilled fish as it seemed quite popular. The ambiance is that of a typical Izakaya and you can watch the kitchen grill your food on a charcoal grill from certain tables.  Our waitress was super sweet and attentive.

Very authentic service and atmosphere where servers welcome you and other customers by shouting really loud in Japanese. The menu changes all the time and is a great place to try authentic Japanese cuisine. Their recent special includes the uni udon and the tofu skewers. Highly recommend the uni udon. If you've never had uni it's very creamy and provides a delicious seafood flavour to the udon. Definite must try. Also highly recommend the Zakkushi skewer set and the chicken karaage. The skewers all have a smoky flavour from the wood fire grill they are grilled on. Each skewer is also so different that it provides a refreshing change of pace and interesting insight into Japanese flavours. The chicken karaage is also fried to perfection with a very crispy skin. It is perfectly paired with a creamy mayo sauce that adds another dimension of texture and flavour. Also would recommend trying out the unique Japanese cocktails and beers that go great with the small bites. The okinomiyaki is very nice if you've never had it before but is much smaller than you think. This place is a great place for drinking and having a small meal. If you're trying to get full it might get a bit pricey as you will have to order more plates. Although the portions may be smaller, it's a great place to try a variety of authentic and delicious Japanese food, plus it also feels like you are in Japan. Definitely give this place a try!!\",\n",

The place is small and cosy, and noisy as well (services will announce order names loudly) which is all part of the experience. Food wise we had ordered a lot of different dishes but I didn't really have a favorite, perhaps it's just not my favorite type of Japanese food. So while everything was pretty good, nothing particularly stood out to me -  besides the raw beef was probably the best. It does have small portion since it's izakaya style.

Except in the evenings when business people  come for after work drinks.  This is my first review. Of all my experience I would give Cactus Club Cafe a 4 star.  The service is always consistent.  A few favourite appetizers I've tried is the calamari, good and tasty. Chicken wings are small and dry.  The shrimp ravioli is amazing. Lettuce wrap is also great! I've tried most of the main dishes.  The short ribs pappardelle with arugula is great.  This was the dish in the picture attached.  I love their specials.

       " [\"Over a month ago, I was talking with the owners of ZeeV's Nutrition Studio as I normally do while picking up my order. They were raving about Cactus Club Cafe (CCC). They recently went there on a date night. Admittedly, I had never been there. I was hoping to go to their Etobicoke location for a work lunch or something, but that never happened when the pandemic hit. We all worked and continue to work from home, thanks to a recent COVID-19 outbreak at work. Thankfully, I was stateside and didn't attend this so-called mandatory function.Earlier this month, ZeeV's organized a dinner with customers, clients, and friends. I am fortunate that I started as a customer, still am one, but have got to know the owners and have developed a cool friendship. As I spent time at their studio, I ended up meeting their customers and clients. It was to the point where I knew practically everyone at this dinner.One of the owners, Vamshi, booked reservations for 13 of us on a Sunday at 5 pm. He booked on a Friday. He got no response, but we still went for it.The previous night, I was in the area to see Trevor Noah. I tend to park in a parking garage across from CCC and walk to Scotiabank Arena. I was heading to the same location to park for dinner.I got a phone call from Zenia as I drove downtown, the other owner and Vamshi's wife. She let me know that he was heading down early to confirm that our reservation was okay. He was concerned to have not got any confirmation. I indicated that I was going to arrive early, so I'd also ask about said reservation if I arrived early.I parked at the parking garage at 16:50 pm. I headed over to CCC and got there early. The entrance is the leftmost entrance when you are on Adelaide Street West. I walked in and was promptly greeted by two women.I indicated that I was here for a reservation under Vamshi. She couldn't find it in the system. She paged her manager to come help. Vamshi showed up, so we did the tag team thing.It turns out that if you are a party of 12 or higher, a different department handles reservations Monday through Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm. Bank hours. This department didn't respond to his request. Then again, he placed it at the end of Friday.The manager was terrific. She asked us to wait while she tried to squeeze us in. She did. She made a weird situation right. We got a long table on the second floor. I learned that CCC has three floors. The first floor wasn't being used. There's also a covered patio.The second floor was gorgeous. The lighting was pretty and different as you walked across the floor. It felt cozy, especially with the dark chocolate leather seats.Our time at this eatery was set to a maximum two hours. We all filed in, sat down, and had a great time chatting and eating.I got the following items:- Bellini- Butternut squash ravioli with prawns *- Cajun chicken sandwich with fries *- Key lime pieI split the * items with Zenia. We wanted to taste more. I'm glad that we did.The owners got two orders of sweet potato fries with garlic aioli. So good! I love sweet potato fries and they were perfectly done. They had the perfect amount of salt on them. The garlic aioli was heavenly. It deserves to be bottled and marketed.My bellini was awesome. It was peach and delicious. I loved it. It looked as pretty as it tasted.The butternut squash ravioli with prawns is CCC's signature dish. It was fantastic! I love butternut squash ravioli. Each ravioli was packed with roasted butternut squash filling. It truly didn't need a large prawn on each one, but I'll take it! The prawns were plump and delicately seasoned to pair with the ravioli. The creamy sauce tied everything together like a liquid bow.The Cajun chicken sandwich was awesome. The chicken was juicy and had a good amount of Cajun seasoning that provided a mild spicy kick. It had coleslaw in it. It was a southern nod that I enjoyed. The bun was so good. You can get gluten-free buns here. Vamshi did so and loved his gluten-free version.I wanted to try the key lime pie. I have been looking for a good tart one. I found it here. I had ten minutes to indulge before our two-hour stay came to a close. I did it.It had the perfect lime tartness that I love. The graham cracker crust was spot on. The dessert was creamy and excellent. I'd come back for this dessert alone.I used the washroom before we all headed out. It was fancy and clean. I believe that there's an elevator in this eatery, so accessibility is covered. Service stands out at CCC. The manager checked up on us after we were seated. Our server made sure we were good throughout our meal. Excellent customer service!We paid for our bills. I paid with a credit card. All was great.It was terrific to finally dine here. I have passed by this CCC a number of times whenever I'm off to see a concert or something at Scotiabank Arena.

       " [\"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. Almost every dish I've had has been outstanding and cooked nearly perfectly, I only really have good things to say about this place. It's cozy & quaint, but really delivers in food quality.This review covers my thoughts on my last visit here:* Pan con Tomate is a classic and fresh starter dish (note that the bread crust can be a bit on the tougher/crunchy side).* Sea Bream Ceviche is delicious (one of my fave dishes in general) and I appreciate the balance of acidity that tastes so satisfying with the raw fish. The tortilla chips have a great texture and are salted just right, pairs very nicely with the ceviche in one bite.* Bone Marrow is so fatty and I love the salt that it comes with. I've had this before and noticed that this time it came with some sort of green sauce which I didn't love (overpowers the mouthwatering bone marrow flavour).* Scallops were cooked perfectly and we really liked the green sauce that accompanied.* Grilled 10oz Picanha Steak (not pictured) is delicious, cooked perfectly medium-rare and seasoned with enough salt to bring out the natural beef flavours. It also has a fatty cap that adds a lot of depth. YUM!* Basque Cheesecake. is. amazing. I don't know what's in there but it manages to soak up a bit of the condensed milk yet isn't too sweet, and the texture is very dense but in a good way. I haven't had anything like this before. It looks simple but I'm impressed every time I come back, like it's my first time trying it again.Side note, I've also had:* Grilled Octopus which I remember being tender and cooked really well.* Meat & Cheese Plate had a yummy selection* Shishito Peppers were well-salted and cooked just enoughPrices are reasonable for the quality of food you receive, and it really just depends what you order because everything adds up. Portions for some dishes might look small but if you order enough it is actually quite filling.

I am glad I made a reservation. Was a perfect place to catch up with my girlfriend with great food and drinks after busy weekdays. Even though the place was busy - the a dimly lit interior somewhat gave us a sense of privacy. The service was excellent. Our server was very good at giving details about the menu to us, his descriptions/suggestions were so good that I wanted to order almost every dish he mentioned! He was also friendly and attentive.We (two) had the following dishes: Food: Shishito PeppersSea Bream Ceviche & ChipsGrilled Octopus (Quarter) Roast Veal Bone MarrowDrink:Isabel Fashioned¡Rebujito!And some draft beer and local craft beers. Impressed by the Roast Veal Bone Marrow. The melty bone marrow came with toasted multigrain sourdough & refreshing Parsley Verde & good quality sea salt. Each item was simple, but eating together - soooo good! Loved this.  The grilled octopus was excellent as well. Tender, perfectly seasoned, and goes very well with butter sauce with a hint of sourness. Eating with the sautéed dandelion underneath the octopus gives another layer of flavor (nice bitterness). Enjoyed this, thank you!!! The shishito was nicely seasoned, fried perfectly leaving the plumpness/crispiness of the peppers. They weren't too pungent or overly salty at all. I loved the shaved salt sprinkled around the peppers. Sea Bream Ceviche was the least favorite food of the night, but they are still good. Just felt that it is not worth the price. Will come back for sure, this is a place for the well executed food and excellent service!\",\n",

We had received a couple of our dishes in a timely manner, but waited almost AN HOUR for the rest of our food. We had seen other tables, who were seated significantly later than us, receive their food (including the same things we ordered) before we did. Maybe they wanted to bring everything out all at once, but an hour is still longer than I would have expected. For all the Basque Cake lovers (and ones who haven't had it yet), it was a solid 8/10 for me. I don't understand the hype for it, but it is delicious nonetheless!

We were seated downstairs which was right next to the kitchen/ bar, and there was music playing, making the environment quite loud, and difficult to have a conversation in without raising your voice a considerable amount. A few staff members were talking at/ over the bar the entire time we were in the restaurant, and some were speaking with inappropriate language, which wasn't the most professional. When going to the washroom upstairs, we noticed there were more tables and it was a much quieter, more enjoyable environment. For an appetizer we got the house made bread, the focaccia was very good, the bread was fluffy and it was sprinkled with the perfect amount of rosemary and salt. However, the sourdough was very very dry. The bread was served with a small dish of good quality olive oil, and balsamic. Due to the style of the dish, I got no balsamic on my bread when it was dipped, but as stated, the olive oil was quality and tasted good on the focaccia. For the main, we got the Capellini and Mafalde Ai Funghi. If you love goat cheese, you'll enjoy the Capellini, the pasta was al dente and the sauce was good. In addition, my friend is not the biggest fan of goat cheese, therefore, she did not enjoy the dish. In my opinion, the goat cheese did overpowered the sun-dried tomato, however, I like goat cheese, so this was not an issue for me. The Madalde Ai Funghi was also cooked al dente, the sauce was creamy and has a strong mushroom flavour. Both pastas has lovely presentation, and we're very filling.

We all liked the latter a lot more since the Mango one was a bit too sour. For apps, we shared the sunchoke dumplings and 2 orders of the adobo bbq pork belly skewers which was one of their specials that night. The uni was a bit too subtle in the dumplings but still good. The skewers were great.Now for the mains: We absolutely LOVED the smoked duck bokkeum and the 90 day dry aged ribeye! So happy with our choices. Both were sliced into thin strips and each bite was so meaty, tender, tasty. Not sure if they usually have this, but we were told there was a 14oz steak available, so we went with the slightly bigger slab instead of the standard 12oz. No regrets there. The truffle fried rice was also yummy but wasn't as much of a standout as the proteins were. I did love that it came with a side of XO sauce though - very Canto.As a New Yorker visiting, I was shocked to see our bill, to see how affordable this decadent meal was.

Nonetheless we overlooked this as we were here to enjoy some of the best Chinese fusion food in town.On to the food: we ordered the pho beef carpaccio, the lobster noodle special, and the Smoked Duck Bokkem. You get the unique experience of receiving a feast for the eyes & nose before digging into your dishes - The hearty plating as well as the delicious aroma of these dishes simply waft at you. Out of these three, my partner and I agreed that the lobster noodle special was indeed very special & would 11/10 order again. It was buttery, smoky, warming, filling yet at the same time refined. We also licked the carpaccio plate clean - it indeed tastes like a bowl of delicious pho. The duck, however, was a disappointing end to the meal.

We saw a pic of the fried crab with noodles and were happy to be upsold. You get a TON of food and the equivalent of 2 huge mains. The wontons were a highlight as were the fried lobster noodles. Flavors overall reminded me of Hakka food. I was just happy none of the food was in foam form, as chic as that's supposed to be. The tom yum cocktail was brilliant.

They have so many dishes I wanted to try but I was also planning on going to the bar/restaurant next door for some tapas - I found myself in big dilemma: so much to eat, so little stomach space!DaiLo is an New Asian restaurant. It means \"big brother\". They have influences from China, Philippines, Burma, Singapore, etc.I knew my top 2 must-tries: truffle fried rice, and octopus tacos. The fried rice doesn\\'t have any meat so, I had to get a protein. Each dish on their menu is meant for 2 people. The server understood my dilemma and told me they can do half portions. So, I went with truffle fried rice, octopus tacos, and duck.As I was reviewing my itinerary for the next day, out came the amuse bouche. And as if that wasn\\'t enough, the chef sent a chicken wing my way. Probably one of the best and tastiest chicken wings from an Asian restaurant I\\'ve had.Everything was as good as I had imagined. The truffle fried rice had truffle shavings and not just fairy dust of it. The duck was tender and had a smokey flavor to it and the accompaniments paired well with the duck. The octopus tacos were my favorite - lightly breaded and fried - simple, soft and had enough flavor. Instead of a tortilla, the shell is a thinly-sliced jicama.I knew I was in trouble when the server told me what they had for dessert. I had to get the white chocolate champorrado (Filipino). Champorrado is basically sweet chocolate rice with the consistency of porridge/ congee/ risotto normally eaten with salty dried fish or by itself. DaiLo\\'s version uses white chocolate, sprinkled with cocoa powder topped with tuile. Yum!So, I didn\\'t have the space for tapas after. And it was alright.The service was fantastic!

It is technically a tasting menu but I've noticed they advertise it as a 5 course meal and definitely was more filling than a regular tasting menu. The staff said they prepare it right there and then so they can accomodate any food restrictions. Since we didn't make a reservation, they only had the bar seating available. The service was relatively quick. We had to pay additional $15 per person if we wanted the main to be the giant prawn, which we had.Food overall was pretty diverse. When you hear Asian fusion, it's normally a westernized version of a traditional food, but the Asian fusion here seemed more like another take on the traditional food. It was definitely an experience I recommend anyone to try. Food was definitely filling and the staff was so nice. One thing I noticed was that the bar was really loud and we couldn't hear partially what the staff was saying. My opinions on the DaiLo Chef's choice were:My favorite would have to be the fried watermelon, 90 day aged beef carpaccio and Smoked trout Pomelo Betel Leaf. Surprisingly the least favorite would have been the giant prawn. It was hard to eat the prawn in general and I didn't like how hard the rice was. Overall, definitely a great place. The food is definitely not traditional, but it's an interesting take on Asian food. I think you get good value for all these meals if you get Chef's Choice compared to a la carte. However I won't recommend paying extra 15 bucks for the giant prawn. Try another main instead. Also get reservations ahead of time and try regular dining. The bar seating was less intimate and the chairs were pretty wobbly.\",\n",

I wanted something somewhat healthy and a quick bite so I ordered the pistachio crusted salmon and the French onion soup. French onion soup was good but not the best I've had. The beef broth did hit the spot since it was freezing outside. The pistachio crusted salmon was delicious and felt like something that was on the lighter side of the menu. Salmon had a nice crust and was soft. The brussel sprouts had a maple sweet glaze that went well with the pistachios and the mashed potatoes were buttery. Overall, this definitely hit the spot!\",\n",

She also kept joking around with us which was nice of her to entertain members of the group. We all ordered a variety of food appetizers: bacon wrapped scallops, cheese bread, and I had the lobster bisque which was really good. They had bread for the table which was also good. It came with either the reg butter or their specialty butter (which I believe had some kind of cheese in it). For dinner I got the Lobster & steak with mash potatoes. It was delicious and cooked to perfection (and yep that still means well done). The steak was juicy and the lobster was bigger than we expected it to be. We were all pleasantly surprised ( those who ordered the steak and lobster). The drinks were also really good. Overall, we had an amazing time at this restaurant and the food was well worth it. I think we were one of the lst tables and no one rushed us to leave. The waitress also made it super easy for us to pay since it was such a bog group of us.

It was a late lunch and the diners were sparse, which is the way i like my restaurants.The lunch menu is limited and the options were sirloin, New York sirloin, prime rib and filet mignon. One chooses how well done the meat is and the sides. Conspicuously the sides were Caesar salad, fries and baked potatoes. Where was the mashed potato? I asked for and the waitress said it is not an issue and I can have it despite it not being on the menu. The steak was excellent and so was the mashed potato. I was with an out-of-town visitor and she had the sirloin and, having a little of it, found it good as well. By the way, ditch the Teriyaki Sirloin. In Japan, teriyaki is designed for fish. It is not for beef, pork or chicken so that is all wrong.We made the mistake of ordering calamari and fried cauliflower for appetizers. The calamari was hardly memorable and a little too floury. It was tasteless too. The cauliflowers were delicious. Ordering both was a mistake because, while I had imagined getting a tray with a couple of each item on it, these were full trays the size of a meal unto themselves!Good deal, but it was too much food.The menu has sandwiches, salads and a modicum of seafood.

For splitting the potato in half?? Then he made it sound like he did us a favour by reducing the cost of an extra side from $16 to $8.75. We didn't ask for 2 carbs as sides, you offered it to us!

Located in a converted mansion, it occupies 2 floors with multiple \\'rooms\\', leather couches, wide comfortable seats, wooden accent interior, and stained glass windows. We came around Christmas time, and the interiors were all decorated with very festive hoiday decorations and small Christmas trees.The first floor has a half open-concept kitchen that you can walk in and peek at what the chefs are doing. It also has spacious dining rooms with ample seatings (that tend to get filled up quickly as soon as it opens, so make a reservation where possibel!).We were seated upstairs by the window (with a lovely mini Christmas tree decoration right beside us), making a nice photo op. There was a bar with screens showing sports games in the middle of the floor, and rooms and dining tables around it. The bar has a different menu (e.g. you can order sliders at the bar). Washrooms are located on the 2nd floor.** FOOD **Food-wise, it\\'s excellent just like in any other The Keg location. Menu seems to be identical in most locations I\\'ve been to in Toronto. We tried their \"Holiday Features\" (special limited-time items) shareable sides, Caesar Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus with Spiced Hollandaise, and they were both super delectable - two of our favourite sides of the night (especially the Caesar Brussels Sprouts - crispy to perfection).For the mains, we ordered Lobster Tail Dinner and Mediterranean Cauliflower. The Lobster Tail Dinner came as 2 large lobster tails that easily slid off the shells. They were tender and perfect. It came with mushroom rice (just okay) and seasonal vegetables (steamed green beans and beets).The Mediterranean Cauliflower was my favourite main dish of the night. It consisted of oven-roasted cauliflower, green garbanzo bean hummus, couscous, pistachio nuts, and tahini lemon sauce. It was SO delicious! The Keg wins for a steakhouse serving the best vegetarian dishes on the menu. I\\'d definitely get this again the next time I visit The Keg.The sides of baked potato, fresh vegetables, mushroom rice, and sautéed mushrooms were all pretty good as well, but the holiday feature items / specials (Caesar Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus) were still the winners.** SERVICE **Great service - no complaints.

I loved it so much that I got it again recently. When I love a menu item, I tend to get it on repeat to the point where I neglect the other items. It's the case when I'm at Gushi. It's now the case here.I dig Detroit-style pizza. The cheese layer is at the bottom of the pizza and the sauce is on top. It's different. Perhaps it's peculiar to folks who are used to the reverse. Live a little. It's yummy.This eatery is in Leslieville. I dropped by in the evening both times. All Green P parking spots on both sides of Queen Street East were packed. Instead, I drove up Jones Avenue a bit and had better luck. I now parallel park on this street and don't even bother trying on Queen Street East.Parking is free along Jones Avenue. Technically, you do need a parking permit if you are parking overnight. However, if you're there for an hour or two, you're fine parking in the evening.Staff have always been friendly and helpful. The first time, I walked in and placed my order for the Truff-guy, which has everything that I love: - Cheese blend- Caramelized onions- Truffle aioli- Roasted garlic cremini mushrooms- Grana padano cheese- Double-smoked bacon- Lemon zest- Fresh thymeI learned my first time that it would take thirty minutes to bake my small pizza. You can't rush perfection. I decided to roam around the neighbourhood to kill some time. It was wonderful getting acquainted with the neighbourhood.On my most recent visit, I called ahead and placed my order. By the time I had arrived, my pizza was ready. If you want to avoid waiting, this option is for you.I paid with a debit card and tipped both times. The transactions were seamless and a breeze.There are seats on the main floor, but they do fill up fast. Both times, I ended up eating in my car. The original thought was to drive home and eat. However, my car smelled so good that I could resist but to devour everything immediately.The Truff-guy pizza is my jam. If you are a huge mushroom fan, you must try it. I love mushrooms and the roasted garlic creminis were so good. There was enough garlic that you tasted it and it mildly lingered after I had eaten my pizza.You definitely get a cheese pull when you grab your first piece of pizza. It was cool. Because you don't see the cheese on top of the pizza, it was a nice surprise seeing cheese strings coming from the middle of the slice.The double-smoked bacon was enough to know that you had a meat protein, but you knew that the mushrooms were the stars of this pizza. Delicious! The pizza was bright with the lemon zest and thyme. You do need to pay attention to the caramelized onions. They don't hit you at full force. Rather, they are subtle. The truffle aioli was fantastic. I could put it on anything that I eat and be the happiest person ever.You do need a drink to wash everything down. I had a bottle of lemon iced tea the first time and a cold can of Diet Coke the second. Both work well and pair nicely with this pizza.This pizza is filling. I first thought that I was full after my second slice. However, the first slice was so good that I polished off the remaining slices. The crust had a good crunch while still being chewy. It was perfectly balanced. It also didn't feel carb-heavy. I never felt sluggish driving home with pizza stuffed in me both times.It you want to save some money staying in Toronto for Detroit-style pizza instead of crossing the border to search for an authentic version, come here.

I ordered the Electric Avenue and it came with a sauce similar to a salsa with Indian spice. It had a kick to it. I ordered garlic parm dipping sauce but it really didn't need it. It came with a curry lime aioli drizzled on top. I might say this aioli is one of the best I've had. I'd give this 5 star but the price is just outrageous. A small pizza which is 4 slices came out to $27 including tax. Unless you can afford this regularly, this is probably a place you come to occasionally. Also the interior is quite small and feels crammed when busy. There's 4 tables of 2 and a bar table with about 5-6 stools. Luckily there's a park with picnic tables across the street.\",\n",

The sides were tasty as well, with a tuna salad, chef's dish, and pickles, according to the menu. See my closeup pics for more details.The chef's knife skills made for a gorgeous looking bento box, and the subtle charring of the veg and steak introduced a nice smoky flavour from the hibachi.This place is sooooo good I want to go back again soon and try more items like the Makunouchi Bento $25, or the Kaisen version for $24.

The food itself was super fresh and delicious. The uni did not have that fishy taste as it was very fresh. The sashimi slices were nicely cut and great size. There was fish chopped into small cubes along with tamago. The portion was perfect and the fish and rice proportion was perfect! Although it was $32 on ubereats, it was definitely worth it.

The hamachi was really good along with the tuna but the ebi was a little too slimy and fishy for us.Negi-T - So...when this was presented, I was a bit confused because I thought it was a Negitoro Roll.

Next up was the appetizer and we decided on the Nodini which was warm knots of bread with a drizzle of oil and herbs on top. It was just enough to tease the rest of the meal. As for an entree, I couldn't help but order a relatively new item on their menu... The gnocchi stuffed with buffalo ricotta, infused with basil, pine nuts, and a few other things too fancy for me to remember. When it came to the table everyone gasped. It was down right beautiful and even tastier to eat. I ate every bite on the plate. Don't believe me? Check out the photos I uploaded on Yelp. We wrapped up our meal with a delicate dessert of mouse sandwiched between two waffles with a light sauce on the side.

I almost didn't get this one but I'm so glad I did. The tacos had grilled white fish with guac, tartar sauce and cabbage. I put lime juice on top and it was amazing! 10/10!Playa Cabana has various locations downtown. It's always super busy so do expect a line if you're coming during lunch and dinner hours. Also, the tacos were on the expensive side, $18-20 for 3 tacos before tip and tax.\",\n",

We had a great night!To start, we opted for some guac which was tasty and had a nice little kick to it. To eat, I split the elotes a la parrilla and an order of tacos al pastor with my husband. The soft tacos come in an order of three but you can add on a fourth, so we did that to share evenly. It was the perfect amount of food for us, especially since the tortilla chips kept flowing! The pork in the tacos was seasoned very well. I'm used to the meat being cubed rather than in strips, so this was different but still tasty. They really packed in the filling, so I left super full. To sip, we shared pitches of mojitos which were nice and strong... The drink menu was quite lengthy and again, perfect for our group of revelers. Mexican in Canada seemed like a risky choice, but this was an ideal meal for us! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for tacos OR a nice group dinner joint.\",\n",

From the food to the staff to the ambiance, Storm Crow Manor was a lot of fun and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a unique restaurant with friendly people and a eclectic menu. We came here on a Thursday and the place was super busy - it felt like it was very full and although we came without a reservation, we were lucky enough to snag a table in the Star Wars room within a few minutes. The hostess was pretty busy running around to check if tables were free, but she was super friendly and kind about it so waiting wasn't a bother. Their menu is mainly just comfort food with fries and burgers, but it was still pretty extensive so we had a good selection of food. We started with the random dice shots and I was lucky to roll a natural 20 so I received a double shot - it was a very simple lemon vodka mix, but was certainly strong enough especially on an empty stomach. The white sangria I got after that was pretty good - not too sweet, but still super tasty!Our food came out without us having to wait too long after that and all the dishes were delicious in their own way. We saw the chickpea fries on someone else's table and had to order them for ourselves - great sauce, interesting texture, but overall a good choice! The poutine also didn't disappoint, I usually don't like soggy fries but I didn't notice the softness this time and just enjoyed the gravy and cheese which was nice. The burger for me was huge - the size of the Hulk one is definitely something to note! It was delicious regardless, but I couldn't finish it given all the food ordered. The salad was super nice also, it very much felt like thought went into it rather than just dressing and lettuce mixed together. Our waitress was nice but hard to flag down at times - it was just so busy and the space was super cramped so it's understandable though.

However, if you're not a sweet tooth, the pancakes does become too heavy after a few more bites. The blueberry compote is extremely sweet. The pancakes on their own felt more like biscuits to me because of how dense they are and they're on the drier side.

So naturally, I jumped at the chance to check it out this past weekend. Even though it was Victoria Day, there was plenty of space both inside in the cozy pub and outside on the patio. If they happen to be full, there is a patio space on the second floor and another indoor space upstairs. The environment can be described as cozy, comfortable and chill. The kinda space that makes you feel at home even though it's your first time there. Friendly staff and great service. My friend recommended the pies and mashed potatoes, so we got the tourtiere and the steak & wild mushroom pie. Both came with mashed baby red skin potatoes, some beans and a roasted yellow pepper. The steak & wild mushroom pie was the winner of the pie battle. The flavors are hearty, strong and the chunks of beef are fork tender. The pie crust is crisp and gives a good counterbalance to the plentiful stuffing. The tourtiere is lighter (in comparison), and the thoughtful addition of the tomato jalapeno chutney further cuts through the heaviness.  Will definitely be back!\",\n",

       " ['The crossed arm dumplings in red oil ($26) may sound like a starter for grumpy old men, but is named after the way the  wonton wrappers are folded and the two tips meet. Having made many dumplings in my youth, this style is much quicker to prepare, compared to the pleated variety, and also allows more filling to be used.  Indeed, each thumb length dumpling at MIMI was stuffed with plenty of the pork and scallion mixture, which could have used more seasonings such as Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, or soy sauce. Maybe it\\'s due to the thicker wrappers or there not being much heat within the \"red oil\" condiment, but the dish was rather devoid of flavours despite the colourful look. The oil is described as roasted chicken oil, which leads me to believe they use the leftover oil from deep frying chickens to make this condiment, something that sounds great in theory. In reality, it doesn\\'t add much additional flavour and really the oil could benefit from more chilies and something pungent like shallots. I can\\'t recall that last time I had shrimp toast ($21 for four pieces; $5.50 for extras), but I must have been young as this dish has been removed from dim sum menus as customers become more health cautious. Pieces of soft white bread sandwich a mild shrimp paste and is deep fried and topped with a sesame crust. The crispy toast was bang on - the crunchy exterior and slight leak of oil is reminiscent of childhood memories. Since MIMI uses two pieces of bread (restaurants previously used an open-faced sandwich format), the carbs did drown out the shrimp taste. The toast could benefit from more filling or incorporating pieces of diced shrimp in order to give it a stronger seafood essence. The scallion and ginger sea bass ($59) uses white leek but lacks ginger making it a fairly neutral main. The soy sauce and scallion oil is poured table side instead of directly from wok to dish, which while nice for presentation purposes, means it lacks the \"scalding\" properties that crisps the skin a bit and causes the sauce to more deeply permeate the meat. All in all, it was a pretty plain tasting dish and is for those who really want to enjoy the fish\\'s flavours - at least it was well cleaned and tasted fresh. For those who are afraid of bones, this dish is perfect as everything is pretty much removed (all I found was one really thin small piece). While the lack of bones makes it much easier to eat, it does mean the fish cools quicker, so be sure to tuck into it right after the sauce is poured.  Presented at the table with a flourish was the four foot belt noodle ($26), stretched to showcase its length before being cut into more manageable two inch segments. While not a terrible dish, the noodle could be thinner as we found it a tad chewy and the sauce needed something else for interest. Although the noodle was covered with a fair amount of chili oil, a salty richer flavour like bean paste or a complex XO sauce would have been a great addition. I preferred the supreme fried rice ($28), filled with umami flavours thanks to the dried scallop, salted egg, and lap cheong sausage. These ingredients do make the rice a tad dry, which MIMI ties to combat by adding diced vegetables and scallions into the dish. Really, I think if there was just more rice to mix with all the other ingredients it would provided the needed moisture.Be sure to listen to their feature dishes, we ordered both and they were my favourite of the evening. The Cantonese chicken ($28) is your traditional fried chicken with shrimp chips. It was executed perfectly at MIMI: the skin delicate and crispy, the meat very juicy, and there wasn\\'t an ounce of pink on the bone (something that can be found at Chinese restaurants and make some squeamish).I loved how the kitchen took the razor clams ($26) and chopped it to pieces and mixed it with wine, garlic, vermicelli, and other herbs before steaming the crustacean. With each bite you get different flavours and textures, a lovely seafood special.',\n",

If you want to try this place at a reasonable dinner time (7-8pm) i would definitely recommend reserving the table early (a month prior). Interior: Great interior. We were sat right next to the one sided mirror in which we were able to see the kitchen but they were not able to see us. Very creative and love the open kitchen concept without the loud sound/smell of cooking in the kitchen. The bathroom was really cool, all black and modern. Overall, the design of the restaurant is super modern and chic. Service: Great service. Our waitress was super attentive and explained the food to us and gave us some recommendation. Really enjoyed the thorough explanation regarding the different provinces and cuisines in china. Mystery drink: 4/10 I got a mystery drink (alcohol free) for 12 dollars. I really didn\\'t like it as it was way too sweet. Shrimp toast: 8/10 We started with the shrimp toast as the appetizer. It was delicious, but for the price, i did expect a little more of a wow factor. Nevertheless, it was a delicious place but not worth 24 dollars. Charsu: 9/10I personally really enjoyed the charsu. It was marinated really well and you could tell the meat was good quality. We have definitely had cheaper charsu, however, you could tell the meat was well prepared and good quality in comparison to other Chinese restaurants. The marinate was good and the beans were paired really well with the charsu. Hidden chicken: 7/10It was a delicious dish, however, i didn\\'t think it represented the traditional Szechuan cuisine. I do think the dish is more catered towards people who might not be familiar with traditional Szechuan food and might not realize the spiciness it entails. I thought it was just fried chicken hidden in chilli peppers as it wasn\\'t spicy really at all. And while it was a good dish with well made chicken, it wasn\\'t a \"Szechuan\" dish. Belted noodle: 9/10Love. This dish was my favourite. The sauce was delicious, the presentation was wonderful. We also goT a little show of the noodle being pulled. I personally thought the noodle was well made with the right amount of chewiness. Shaved ice: 6.5/10 It was ok. I could barely taste the oolong as the strawberry reduction is super overpowering. Felt more like a smoothie. Overall: 8/10 Would definitely come back as theee are a few items i would like to try. It\\'s a little on the pricier side but i do think it\\'s worth it for upscale Chinese food.',\n",

The salad dressing for the cabbage used to be on the table pre-covid, but now they add it for you before bringing you your food so I found the cabbage quite bitter and underdressed as I used to drench it in sauce aha.Other than the dressing no longer being self-serve, this spot is just as I remembered it!

It's a small space, probably no more than 30 people will fit, but it feels more cozy than cramped.The menu, while large, seems mostly similar to each other at first. Then while reading through I began to feel like the small differences between options was more like customizing my preferences than being limited.My waitress was very busy (solo serving the whole room) but came to me as quickly as possible. She was extremely friendly despite being obviously swamped.I ordered original fish katsu and received it in an appropriate time frame. The fish itself was a bit bland, and the sauce was very mild in flavor. Good, but mild. The ginger was a nice addition to kick the flavor up a notch. The rice was perfectly cooked, but it was just compressed white rice, not sticky rice, so it fell apart very quickly when it met the sauce of the fish katsu. Positives; the cabbage salad and its drizzled sauce was a VERY nice addition to the plate. It helped tremendously at cutting through the heaviness of the fried fish and thick sauce. Big kudos on that one. Also the onion soup that came with it was beautiful. Flavorful and delicious. No complaints on that at all. Unrelated to the food, there is an ATM right outside the entrance and Katsudon offers (at least at the time of this) 10% off all cash payments.\",\n",

Was it as good as the tuna? Perhaps not, but I recommend ordering it.A little less underwhelming dishes were the Bibb Salad and the Lamb.

For the price, you're getting quality meat and seafood, cooked perfectly, but lacking flavour.Everything was the PERFECT texture, but I found that a lot of the dishes were NOT that FLAVOURFUL.  The dishes I had seemed to be lacking herbs, spices and flavours other than salt and butter.  EUROBASS EN CROUTE:  The eurobass is cooked inside a pastry that you actually don't eat because it is meant to be purely part of the cooking technique! It keeps the fish extremely tender and moist. The dish is brought to the table fresh from the oven, then served after the top layer of pastry is removed and the fish is deboned. The sauce that accompanies the fish is decadent and buttery. Very yummy! There aren't a whole bunch of flavours in this dish, but I imagine this is so that you can taste the purity of the succulent fish (with lots of butter sauce)!ZIGGY STARDUST DISCO EGG:  What a pretty dessert! Apparently it takes 3 days to make. It consists of a dark chocolate egg that has been elaborately decorated, which you smash using a spoon. Inside are apricots and hand rolled truffles! I believe they said the chocolate is Peruvian chocolate, but I can't remember 100%. I have to say, this dessert is prettier than it is tasty, but perhaps it's because it's strange to eat that much dark chocolate in one sitting (even splitting it with many friends). If I could take it home to munch on over the span of a week, I might have enjoyed it more.FRIED CHICKEN: The chicken was extremely tender and the batter very crispy.  I found that it was not extremely flavourful, even with the decadent sauce.SEAFOOD PLATTER: The shrimps were INCREDIBLE.  I could eat 20 of those myself.  The oysters were great too!\",\n",

The portion size is actually smaller than it looked because the skillet is quite shallow though. The fries were very average. It also came with challah bread, which was good and decently soft.I also got a customized fruit smoothie ($8), which was fine- it ended up basically being like fruity milk rather than a thicker smoothie consistency.The roast beef grilled sandwich ($21) was also pretty good as the bread was nicely toasted and the thinly slices roast beef with mushrooms was tasty.The halva ice cream crunch ($11) was delicious- high quality creamy vanilla bean ice cream with some unique toppings such as the sweet halva shavings, pistachio crumbles, and rice crispies for a bit of crunch.The interior of the restaurant is very nice as it has an open feel with fairly high ceilings and lots of natural light coming through the windows. The warm colored wooden furniture with a more traditional style gave it a homey kind of feel. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the service speed was pretty quick.

We were delighted with everything- we were seated right away, despite the restaurant being so busy; the waitress was very nice; we were dressed very casually, but they still seated us; everything we ordered was so delicious.First, we ordered the bread platter (focaccia and sourdough) and the artichoke salad.

Definitely a stellar pasta.Another dish that really impressed me was the artichoke salad with pickled fennel. It was so dainty and addictively acidic.

The Cacio e Pepe was made with sheep's milk cheese and black pepper. Super simple, not too creamy or cheesy - really good. The Amatriciana has chili, tomato and some sort of bacon. Really simple. I actually combined the 2 of them and the Cacio really balanced out the tomato in the Amatriciana. We obviously ordered dessert which was a Sticky Toffee Pudding with Ice Cream.

No major entree. Just an appitezer, and a pasta.To start - we ordered a prosciutto, a raw cow cheese, a raw goat cheese. Initially thought it was a bit pricey, but the charcuterie board came with pickled peppers/cauliflower, green apple slices (sliced beautifully thin), roasted spicey pecans, and a small bowl of honey. It was very good. The raw goat cheese was my favorite. I ordered the Amatriciana - it was very simple, delicious and had a nice bite to it spice wise.

The mussels, chicken/pork, shrimp and other meats are all marinated and cooked to be very moist and the rice and salad are seasoned perfectly. The only downside of the restauraunt is the size. Traditionally Kamayan Feast/Boodle Fights are shared with large families or large groups of friends. At this location its only a small amount of tables which max out at maybe 4-6 people?

The halibut with a red pepper purée and table side served tomato broth was our favourite.

       " [\"Patria is one of our favourites in Toronto, and we've come here at least 5 times over the years. It consistently puts out great Spanish food. Most recently, we ordered via Uber Eats some of our favourite dishes. Here is a review of the best dishes according to us:1. Paella - we've tried the seafood paella, vegetable paella, and during the holidays the lobster paella. The paella here is excellent, it's slightly more herby than those from Valencia. The seafood is always fresh and juicy, and the rice is perfectly soft with some crisp. It's well seasoned and a great choice. The paella patria is a solid choice to start.2. Pan ton tomato - a classic, it's delicious3. Pimientos de padron - padron peppers in salt, also a classic4. Selección de Embutidos - excellent quality meat, the best ones are the jamón iberico and salchichón5. Brussels bravas - these are for sure better than the Patatas bravas, and we love that one already too.Dishes we've tried but are just okay - butter lettuce salad, Croquetas de Setas.The only downside to Patria is the price - while it may not look expensive on the menu, the portion size is small for the price. You can easily expect to pay $100 for two just for food.We will definitely be coming here over and over again in the future.\",\n",

The patio was definitely one of the best in the city, sheltered by neighbouring buildings and completely covered, with comfortable seats and romantic lighting. We ordered paella right away and a bunch of tapas and racion, and were very happy with how the food was brought out in stages and portions were adjusted so that our entire party could try everything and we weren't overwhelmed with plates. The food was delicious, especially the pulpa (grilled octopus) and embutitos. The server (Daphne) was attentive and welcoming and made us feel very comfortable. The manager was hospitable and had a dry and amusing sense of humour. We had a great night and literally did not want to leave!!!\",\n",

Their paella is great and they have a lot of other great classic dishes - especially their meats and cheeses. To be frank, I remember this spot being a bit better pre covid - it was an easy 5 stars for me then - and I still love Patria but it didn't quite blow me away as well as it did before. Here's the rundown of the food: - Croquetas: delicious mushroom croquetas with a truffle relish, I love the texture on these - Crudo: a classic with perfect balance of acidity - Pan Con Tomate: one of my favourites, so simple yet so elegant - Meatballs: these were much better when they were wagyu, but they're still pretty good now - Patatas Bravas: another one of our favourite dishes with lots of egg and a lightly crispy potato- Seafood Paella: loved the scallops especially but I do remember it being seasoned differently when I came here pre-Covid, still pretty good nonetheless Overall I'd say this is a delicious spot to try and I love the vibes here - especially the art with some wonderful paintings on the east side of the restaurant. It's on the pricey side, but worth experiencing at least once.\",\n",

The one drawback were the fries. They were very overdone - either old and refried or just left in the oil too long? It didn't look bad. They were thin cut but not sure why it was hard and wasn't the same as previous orders from this place. Our server replaced it and it was better than the ones that came with our dish, but was still a bit overdone. Tbh I think the oil might have been too hot or something was amiss with it.

My partner was easily convinced into order their signature burger, easy compromise.The food was delicious and well packaged, but for the price, I had to knock off one star. The lobster roll was everything I dreamed of, but for $25 I really expected more than a 4 inch roll with maybe a quarter cup of lobster. The whole thing took me all of 3 bites to eat, in less than 2 minutes. Tasty, but such a disappointment. Many mixed emotions here. On top of that, you have to order a side, but the price of the side is not included in the combo so I had to pay an extra $5 for fries, which was...not great. I'm glad they forced me to order the fries though, because they ended up being the main part of my meal since my lobster roll disappeared in 2 minutes. I was hungry after, and very jealous of my partner's burger, which he enjoyed and was a generous portion (also required to pay extra for a side).I cannot give 5 stars based on how disappointed I was, but I will also not leave a bad review because I believe the in-person dining experience will be much different.

What a let down... .but that just went to prove how popular the dish is.. We decided to dine at the restaurant anyways and were seated by a pleasant host in the back, cozy patio. I asked for the Scotch egg appetizer right away since I remembered it being delicious.. It was tastier than before and the little salad that came on the same plate had a very nice, slightly sweet dressing on it.. As for my entree, I couldn't decide if I should go for the butter chicken because it is usually too sweet and creamy in the Indian restaurants I have had it at. Anyway, I thought I would try it and ...it has my vote for the best butter chicken in town!!  Chicken thighs were used, perhaps, but at least it was not breast meat which is served in most Indian restaurants. And it was the right spicyness ..

The steak in my friend's steak pie was so flavourful and tender. A lot of the time I've had dry and not tasty meat in pies such as this. When it came time to pay I reached inside my backpack for my wallet and found that the lid on my container of cherries had popped off. There were mushed cherries at the bottom of my backpack, it was quite gross. The waitress saw the displeasure on my face and when I asked for a couple of napkins she offered to wet a couple for me. What service! She even got me a ziplock bag so that my cherries would not create more of a mess for me. The service was impeccable and sitting at the back enjoying the atmosphere was lovely.

       " ['A simple old school bistro with legitimate French fare. The sort of place you would love to have within a few blocks. These have pretty much disappeared from the scene in New York. Glad to see they survive in Toronto.You have a choice of two courses for $48, or 3 for $58, and you can decide at the end. I went with the charcuterie as a starter. This included a nice piece of pate de campagne, duck rillettes and what was described as \"Auvergne prosciutto\" - but turned out to be two slices of a coarse salami - not sure if this was intended as a bit of humor. This came with two slices of bread, which were completely inadequate to handle the generous portion of rillettes and pate, so I was glad I had plumped for the extra sourdough bread. La Portena had a nice appetizer size salade Nicoise as her starter, with seared tuna. No complaints there.For a main course, I had the daily special, confit du canard, which came with mashed potatoes. I believe the sauce contained port. This was perfectly executed, simple French food. La Portena had the fish of the day (probably halibut) served over ratatouille. Again nothing fancy, basic well cooked French food.We shared one dessert, a flourless chocolate cake -again nothing out of the ordinary but good.Beverages were the house cocktail, glasses of the Berthier Sauvignon Blanc and Cotes du Rhone.   Service was excellent. Un bon repas!',\n",

It was a 4 course meal and all the savoury food made my taste buds explode like fireworks and the atmosphere was on point. Beautifully decorated restaurant with personable staff who all speak French and have great wine recommendations.. I couldn\\'t ask for more. Our night felt like we had travelled to Quebec. Starters:Foie gras with black truffle- Made in house. Lots of umami flavour with less \"heaviness\" than the usual Foie gras which was perfect. It came with these savoury/sweet jelly to pair with. We were impressed with their Foie gras especially when we had gone to a famous restaurant in Montreal just last month. We enjoyed Le Baratin\\'s more! Atlantic cod dumpling with Lobster bisque- this was my order and I wish I could have had a dozen more refills. It\\'s everything you wished it would taste like. Absolutely delicious but what surprised me was the Atlantic cod dumpling. They tried to mimic the texture of lobster and the flavour was certainly just like it. I forgot it was an Atlantic cod until writing this right now because I thought it was lobster. The texture was a bit more grainy and not quite lobster but similar enough for me to think it could be and wondering how they infused lobster flavours if it wasn\\'t. Roasted scallops with dry vermouth butter sauce- scallops perfectly cooked, sauce was creamy. No complaints here. Lovely. Main:Beef tenderloin with truffled mash potatoes- perfectly cooked to medium rare. The truffle taste isn\\'t as strong as you think but that\\'s not a con. Their mashed potatoes are so smooth and buttery. My partner thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Roasted rack of lamb with truffle mashed potatoes- I\\'m excited to tell you about this. Perfectly roasted lamb with flavours that just continued to pop in my mouth after the lobster bisque. The dish came with 3 racks and you bet I cleaned those bones right up with no shame. The \"jus\" that came with it only enhances the flavours and the mashed potato was perfect for absorbing the jus and complimenting the meat. I\\'ve had my share of lamb and some places give you such a small bone or piece with little meat, but not here. I was already full by the end of this dish! Cooked medium rare. Dessert:Crème brûlée- torched nicely with a good cream consistently below. My partner really enjoyed the orange flavour aftertaste that they put because it was a nice change. Personally I prefer the classic. Flourless chocolate cake- this was well made but not my favourite dessert (personal preference). Or perhaps I was quite full already. Wine: Our server recommended us an amazing bottle of red wine. It was also my favourite red wine of the year. We couldn\\'t finish it all because I\\'m a light weight so we brought it home to enjoy. It is the 2018 Sancerre. I\\'ll include a picture with my review. This dinner was a surprise reservation my partner made and it was probably my favourite meal of 2021. It just hit all the right spots from their amazing   service, staff, atmosphere, and food. I felt like I travelled somewhere French and considering it\\'s Covid, this means a lot. I can\\'t wait to try their regular menu!!',\n",

But above and beyond the food, the service was worthy of at least one Michelin star. Our French-accented server was the definition of lovely. She was engaged, and provided a curated list of her favourite spots for my upcoming trip to France.L\\'assiette de charcuterie ($18) was the perfect way to start our meal. The savory spread of duck rillettes, pâté, proscuitto and salami was made for sharing. The duck rillettes were a highlight, and it was evident that the duck legs had prepared in a traditional way: dry-brined and braised in aromatic stock, then finely shredded and mixed with duck fat. It was a gourmet combination with the baguette.\"',\n",

The homemade cured salmon was lovely and flavorful, offering a pleasant introduction to the main course to come. Duck had a wonderful Port wine sauce, over the rare breast cut, accompanied by the rich  potatoes Dauphinoise. I love a good creme brulee; the rendition at Le Baratin could have had a bit more flavor, and unfortunately the hardened caramelized sugar was not on point.In a subsequent visit, I had the Salade Nicoise Albacore (seared albacore tuna loin with salad nicoise) as my appetizer, followed by Steak-Frites (marinated striploin AAA with shallot sauce, served with mixed greens & frites) as my entree and Creme Caramel as dessert. The nicoise salad was absolutely lovely, light and flavorful, with sweet drop peppers stealing the centre stage on this dish. Steak-Frites had good flavors, with crispy and well seasoned frites, although the steak itself was quite small. The creme caramel offered a light sweet finish to the meal.Service was good.

I suddenly had a craving for decadent food laced with rich sauces, and that is how my spouse and I ended up at Le Baratin.Located on Dundas Street West, close to Brock Avenue, Le Baratin is a compact bistro with simple but cute decor.For appetizer I ordered Pela des Aravis (potato, bacon, onion & Reblochon), which was brought to the table in a hot skillet. Considering I had dreams of decadent food and rich sauces, this appetizer perfectly fit the bill. The potato was immersed in a creamy sauce, the richness enhanced by bacon, all covered by melted Reblochon, a soft washed-rind and smear-ripened French cheese made in the Alpine region of Savoy from raw cow\\'s milk. It was so rich and creamy that it might had been better served with toast and used as a spread over the toast.For my main I had Magret de Canard, sauce au Dubonnet (roasted duck breast with sweet vermouth \"Dubonnet\" sauce and Jerusalem artichoke-potato Dauphinoise). The duck was served rare, perfectly cooked and tender. The potato was rich and lovely, perfectly complementing the duck.I was so impressed with the appetizer and the main that I decided to try  their desserts and ordered the tarte tatin, an upside-down pastry in which the fruit - in this case apple - is caramelized in butter and sugar before the tart is baked. Unfortunately that evening the tarte tatin preparation was off; it was the worst tarte tatin I\\'ve ever had.When I made the reservation, I informed them in advance that my spouse is vegan. The chef prepared a wonderful ratatouille for my spouse. We really appreciated that the chef went out of his way to accommodate my spouse\\'s dietary needs. Unfortunately, on a subsequent visit, the person taking the reservation was not willing on passing the vegan dietary request to the chef.Service was fine.

Certain restaurants do not begin well. Certainly restaurants begin well, but soon change for the worse. Santouka is still great.The ramen is authentic, unlike other chains employs Japanese kitchen and waitstaff and it certainly is delicious.Yet, one pays for it! More on that at the bottom.I ordered their mainstay special Toroniku in shoyu flavour. The waiter asked me if I like it in a large or regular and I went with the latter because I can barely ever finish my bowls. Their special Toroniku chashu (slices of pork) were tasty, but certainly more dry than years past. Not sure if it was just my slices or all their pork is slightly drier now. The noodles were delicious and slighly chewy, which is the way I like them, and the broth was creamy and tasted like soya sauce. A good combination! The Toroniku is served tsukemen style, which is to say the diner dips the  meat, green onions, etc. into the meat. The Torononiku is also available in salt and miso flavours. They also serve regular ramens, as well as cold noodles for the summer.Just like day one when they opened they are still playing jazz on the sound system, but unlike those days the restaurant was half empty. I remember when the wait to get in was an hour long before settling down for 20 minutes. Today at lunch there were three tables occupied at noon.Prices are up everywhere for everything, and Santouka was always more expensive than others, but $24 for a ramen stings a bit. Ramen in Japan is $8 to $10 after all! No thanks to beverages and appetizers therefore! Finally, the cash machine prompting for 18% or 20% or 25% tip is.just.ridiculous. A joke. Give it up. Just for that I had to lower my grade by a star. Made me miss Japan where tipping does not exist. Yes, we are in Canada, but let us get real, greedy businesses and business owners. Just post your actual price and eliminate tipping. Do not tell me that the ramen is $24. Tell me that the ramen is $28 and stop asking me to pay you in two different ways. Transparency and honesty should be in. As importantly, tipping used to be 15%. What the heck is wrong with people asking for 25%? Why be so modest? Make the options 50 or 70%! hey, why not? Why stop at 25%?? How did businesses get by on 15% tip when they are asking for 25% now?? I hit cancel and punched in my own 15%. Why? Because I liked the service. Otherwise, I would not tip for no or bad service to begin with.',\n",

There are less people dining there, which might be because Jinya and Kinton have opened locations nearby. That works for me because I love the Santouka ramen and dislike the line-up.I need to live a little because as usual I ordered the Toroniku miso and really enjoyed it. Their exclusively imported chashu was as good as ever. The jowls are perfect to be eaten on their own or as intended with the ramen. However, things are getting very pricey for a ramen at $18.50. The noodle is tasty and the broth has some depth. When was the last time anyone said that about Kinton's ramen? Maybe around 2010??You can now also modify your broth's taste and choose your noodle kind. The taller girl was providing good service, but the taller man was rather indifferent. Still, they are fine and as long as they do not lower their quality I will be back. Please please don't Canadianize or dilute your ramen like other places.Santouka is still pushing its luck by not offering the mandatory egg with its ramen, which is a shame, trying to sell bowls, fruity drinks and alcohol and really needs to open a couple of more outlets (unless it makes them like Kinton lower quality and diluted).\",\n",

It felt like all of Italy was brought to Eataly to eat. I wanted to go shopping, but I didn't have a place to cook anything. I tried the cannolis the next day. I didn't enjoy them as much as I wanted. Maybe I should have eaten them the same day. I expected the shell to be firm and crunchy with a sweet delicious filling, but the cannoli was neither. Not sure if these were great cannolis that I just didn't like or if the cannolis were just truly not good. I will have to try a cannoli again at a great Italian spot.\",\n",

Been wanting to go for a while and I did not regret it when I finally got the chance. They have a wide range of both mocktails and cocktails. If the ones we tried they were all fantastic and fun. Whatever your fancy there is something for everyone. The appetizers were amazing too. House baked breads and calamari. Though I'm not the biggest fan of calamari this has to have been one of the best experiences I've ever had. Tender, salty, and flavourful. Great way to start the meal. The steak was similarly succulent and beautifully plated. Since, we were here and surrounded by cheese wheels we also had to try some pasta. Though the cacio e pepe looked amazing and was being prepared table side the carbonara was calling me. It was so rich and creamy. All the dishes really left me fulfilled but still wanting more. For dessert there we got tiramisu and rum cake. I probably would have passed on the cake had it not been on the prix fixe menu. However, given they have other new seasonal options I might have gone for something else like a yuzu sorbet had it been on the menu then. Overall, Toca is just an amazing dining experience from the elegant restaurant, to the fantastic and friendly service, and the mouth watering food. I'd highly recommend everyone go at least once. I'm personally checking my day planner for when I will have an opportunity to drop by again. One small criticism is their chair leather is falling apart.

EVERYTHING WAS DELIGHTFUL.It is truly rare to have a restaurant experience that is pleasant in every way from start to finish.Bravo to all of the staff and members of TOCA for delivering such amazing work!!',\n",

Reservations are recommended as they seem to be full all the time.We had an absolutely lovely dinner to celebrate a birthday and they made it extra special with great service and wonderful dishes. We had the beef carpaccio, spaghetti carbonara and the porchetta. Each dish had it's own unique spin to make it different. I liked that the beef carpaccio wasn't too salty or swimming in oils and made for a very clean starter. The spaghetti carbonara is completed by tossing in a large parmigiano reggiano wheel in the middle of the room before serving (you can watch them do it). The porchetta is 32 hours slow roasted and absolutely melts in your mouth. Would recommend all three dishes.Service was superb and our waitress was friendly despite being busy. One absolutely delicious decadent dinner!\",\n",

It's a nice place and most people were in business casual attire but there is no dress code.The staff was on point-friendly but not pushy. The wine menu has an index and prices average $15-$20 a glass (Canadian). There were some bottles listed at $1,000 + as well.They have a regular menu and a prix fix menu. Dinner for 2 will be around $75 a person or more. But, everything was perfect. We opted for a caprese appetizer that included lobster to split. It was $28 so definitely a splurge. We both opted for the prix fix option which invluded 3 courses.  They were accommodating to our questions regarding food prep and carbless options. The parsnip soup was creamy and delicious. The steak was perfectly cooked. We did split one dessert (and took the other home) which was not sugar free but yum!Toca is great for a date night or special occasion!\",\n",

       " [\"My husband brought me here for our anniversary and we had the most amazing Saturday brunch. The buffet was amazing - there were different types of seafood including fresh oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, and lobsters. They constantly refilled the seafood station which was great and we certainly had our fair share of oysters! They had breakfast food like eggs benedict, sausages, bacon, and this delicious banana bread French toast (highly recommend). There was also chicken, vegetables, fish, and even pasta. You will also find a nice salad bar but to be honest I skipped this completely because seafood over salad any day.Dessert is located in a neat little room in the middle of the restaurant - chocolate fondue with fruits and marshmallows, chocolate cakes, cheesecakes, petits choux... selection was definitely decent. Word of caution - near the end of the buffet they don't restock the dessert so try to get your hands on dessert earlier and don't wait until the last minute!Aside from the delicious food the brunch comes with bottomless mimosas. Bottomless meaning they keep refilling your drink (which they really do).Service was spectacular. We were celebrating a special occasion (as with some of the other diners) and they made us feel really welcome. They even prepared a cute dessert plate to wish us a happy anniversary. My husband had secretly dropped off flowers the day before and they were accommodating and had the bouquet ready at our table when we arrived.Overall I had a wonderful experience and I would recommend coming here for a special meal/treat.\",\n",

       " [\"Lovely place for breakfast! Came here this past weekend with my boyfriend to start off my birthday celebration and it was a great start. TOCA is located on the second floor of the Ritz Carlton and it's decorated very festive due to Christmas coming up but it was very welcoming. This restaurant wasn't overpacked and hectic like other breakfast places instead it was very calm and relaxing. Seating was very comfortable and we had the option to order from the menu or experience the breakfast table. We opted for the breakfast table and it was very simple including an omelette station (kudos to the gentlemen there because he made the perfect egg whites omelette).One of my favourites of the breakfast table is the bottled juices that are available and the green juice was delicious. My boyfriend and I were able to enjoy both coffee and green juice in the same meal. I don't think I've been to a breakfast 'buffet' that included green juice which was a wonderful addition. Overall I would come back here for the lovely atmosphere and calming experience. I think the brunch would be very worthwhile so I'll keep in mind next time. Service was good but not excellent, minor details but nothing to express concern over. It would have been nice if our server was slightly more attentive but all in all, a nice place to enjoy a simple breakfast.\",\n",

       " [\"This fancy restaurant is located on the second floor of the Ritz Carlton - walking in, you'll notice the large cheese cellar, as well as the open kitchen. Our table had these very pretty plates on each seat acting as placeholder; I went straight to the one with the Prince of Bel-Air. Apparently there's an artist who hand paints these designs on each plate, and she was here introducing her products the last time my colleagues came.We had a fixed set menu offering choices for an appetizer (caprese or porchetta), primi (no choice, it was the lobster gigli), secondi (branzino or lamb / agneau), and finally, dolce (tiramisu or panna cotta).We were served bread and olive oil to start, and then each handed a gazpacho shooter. The soup was okay, quite aromatic but also just very similar to V8 in flavour. As we drank our wine and chatted, we were served our appetizers.Everyone at the table chose the caprese - and it was a fantastic choice. A generous disk of fresh mozzarella cheese was placed atop a slice of tomato, with some simmered tomato sauce at the bottom. The cheese was so good; it had such depth and texture.Our primi came a little while later. The al dente gigli was the perfect vessel for coating the creamy sauce, and each plate had a decent chunk of lobster meat. It was quite good and homely, and I found myself chasing after the sauce.The secondi came next; I was the only one around the table who ordered the branzino. Everyone raved about the lamb racks, and I found my branzino okay. I wasn't as big a fan of the tomato sauce, but the branzino itself was well seasoned and fried to be quite crispy. I did find, however, the accompaniments of squid bits and mussels a tad peculiar. This one dish was a slight miss for me.We then ordered a cheese board to share, and there were a variety of cheeses served. One of the boards included blue cheese, but both had pecorino, parmesan, and some other of your usual suspects.Finally, dessert came. Again, everyone around the table got the tiramisu unanimously. Unfortunately, I found this particular presentation to be lacking as well. There was a ball of gelato and thin disk of chocolate served alongside a demi sphere of tiramisu. The tiramisu was okay, but nothing groundbreaking.As we had ordered two bottles of white (a beautifully buttery and complex Dom Bonneau du Martray 2007) and three separate different reds (each wonderful in their own right), the sommelier gave us a 1983 vintage port on the house.Overall, it was a wonderful evening - the food was decently good with some hits but other misses, but the wine was excellent. Service was phenomenal, and we had a great time!\",\n",

       " [\"My buddy hosted his daughter's 1st birthday at TOCA for brunch last Sunday. It's not everyday that i'm dining at the Ritz Carlton, but since my buddy graciously picked up the bill (~$94 per person), I was quite excited to check it out. Overall, my girlfriend and I were quite impressed with this upscale buffet. The attentiveness of the staff at TOCA really stood out to me. Our mimosas were constantly being refilled and our napkins were folded after leaving the table. The service was top notch and my buddy also thought the service was much better than the Windsor Arms. Some of the highlights for me were the seafood bar (lobster tails galore), the prime rib and the tiramisu. Of course, the bottomless mimosas also elevated the experience. They also had a booze-y section with bottomless sangria and  Bloody Caesars.Sure, a $94 brunch buffet might be a bit excessive, but TOCA is perfect for the special occasion. It's an upscale environment with first class service. You will not be disappointed by the food and drink either.\",\n",

       " ['I have been wanting to try TOCA\\'s Sunday brunch buffet for over 2 years, but didn\\'t really have an event to celebrate to justify the cost. However, when I found out that they were having a Saturday brunch buffet for a reduced price, I decided to make the splurge. The hot food variety on Saturday is significantly less than what they offer on Sunday, which they have fairly stated on their online menu. However, they still had the \"breakfast staples\" such as sausages, bacon, pancakes and egg benedicts. Other hot food includes a lamb stew, roasted vegetables, a pan fried fish dish in a broth and a pasta dish. Nonetheless, the main reason why I wanted to go to TOCA was for their seafood bar (lobsters, king crab legs, oysters and smoked fish), which they also serve on Saturday. So to me, I find it more value for money to go on a Saturday. The lobsters were smaller than expected, approximately 2-3 ounces per tail. Most of the ones I ate had a decent texture, but there was approximately 2 half tails I had that were quite chewy (over-blanched?). I was surprised that the crab legs have a \"strong\" sweet crab flavour! As most of the time the crab legs are tasteless and often have a hint of \"icy\" flavour as they are not completely defrosted. I also really enjoyed the smoked salmon and trout. They had a hint of smokey-ness and was mildy salted. The cocktail shrimps were big and had a \"crispy\" texture! The oysters were \"meh\". They were really small, sometimes shriveled up and occasionally quite \"fishy\". I only had a few (max 5) as I was afraid my stomach won\\'t be able to handle it. Another thing I was looking forward to at TOCA was their cheese, since they have a cheese cave (which is a glass room and not really a cave). However the 3 cheeses they had on offered were disappointing. The blue cheese variety didn\\'t have the \"tangy\" kick. The other two cheeses were hard cheeses, which typically suggest they are aged and should have a bold flavour profile. However, they were prerty much tasteless and some pieces tasted \"chalky\". I was also disappointed that TOCA didn\\'t label their cheese. They only had a generic sign saying \"Selection of Artisan Cheese\". In the future, I hope TOCA would replace one of the hard cheese with a soft cheese like triple cream brie. I\\'m not a dessert kind of person, but I know Ritz Carlton, Hong Kong are famous for their dessert. Hence, I assumed the dessert served at TOCA would be similar. The desserts were beautifully presented and overall, they were pretty good! They had a decadent chocolate cake, a pistachio apricot mousse, creme brulee and a chocolate fondue. My favourite was the mousse. The sweetness was well balanced, the mousse was smooth and creamy. The creme brulee was a tad too sweet for me but had quite a significant amount of vanilla bean seed! The chocolate cake was rich but was too sweet for me. I would suggest sharing the piece. However, I do like the layers of moist chocolate cake and chocolate ganache.Tip: Be prepared that for the first 30 mins of the buffet, most of the dishes (except for the desserts and salads) would be empty or only have a few pieces left. It\\'s not that the food is replenished slowly (TOCA did a good job replenishing and service was great!), it\\'s just that everyone was hungry. Plus, on the day I went 95% of the tables were filled.',\n",

Though the prices are not cheap, they are known for their food. But when the entrees came, we were both like ... That's it? It's the portion of a child. The pasta was like 3 bites.

A fellow Yelp Elite in Columbus, Ohio left them a great review so I was sold. I trusted his opinion. After discovering how close it was, I looked out the window and saw a line of people waiting outside the door. The Yelp reviews and photos immediately sealed the deal even further for me. The menu helped too! Tacos and sushi? Who knew?I had been traveling a bit so I ordered online through their website. It took a while as a message popped up and prevented me from being able to order online during their busiest hours. That was fine with me. I was happy to wait. After I was able to place my order, the wait to pick up was rather normal. The restaurant is very small but quaint. I enjoyed the dimly lit space and overall vibe it had. It was obvious why it was so popular. I ordered several items, all delicious. I got the vegetable gyoza as an appetizer, a shrimp tempura roll, and a specialty roll, The Red Dragon (if I can remember correctly).
